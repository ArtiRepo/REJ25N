### Translation of LTL Formula: **G(a and !b)**  

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:  
1. **Original Formula**: `G(a and !b)`  
2. **Parsing Tree Breakdown**:  
   - **`G`** (Global operator): Requires that its subformula holds **in every state** of the execution.  
   - **Subformula**: `a and !b`  
     - **`a`**: Atomic proposition ("a is true at the current time").  
     - **`!b`**: Negation of atomic proposition ("b is false at the current time").  
     - **`and`**: Logical conjunction ("both subformulas must hold simultaneously").  
   - *Tree Structure*:  
     ```  
           G  
           |  
         (and)  
         /   \  
        a    !b  
              |  
              b  
     ```  

3. **Rebuilding Meaning (Bottom-Up)**:  
   - **Base propositions**:  
     - `a` ≡ "a holds (true) in the current state".  
     - `!b` ≡ "b does not hold (false) in the current state".  
   - **Combination (`a and !b`)**:  
     "In the **current state**, a is true AND b is false".  
   - **Global Operator (`G`)**::  
     "`(a and !b)` must hold **in all states, now and forever**".  

4. **Refined Natural Language Translation**:  
   > **"Throughout the entire system execution, `a` must always be true and `b` must always be false."**  

#### Constraints Over Time:  
- **When satisfied?** The formula requires that **in every single state** of the trace:  
  - `a` is **true**, and  
  - `b` is **false**.  
- **Violation condition**: If **any state** (even one) violates `a and !b` (e.g., `a` is false, OR `b` is true), the entire formula fails.  
- **Scope**: Constrains **all time points**—no state is exempt.  

#### Example Sequences:  
- **Satisfying Trace** (only `a` ever occurs):  
  `{a} → {a} → {a} → {a} → ...`  
  ▶ Every state has `a=true` and `b=false` (since `b` is absent).  

- **Violating Trace Examples**:  
  1. State where `a` is false:  
     `{a} → {} → {a} → ...`  
     ▶ Fails at state 1: `a=false` (and `b=false` → still violates `a and !b`).  
  2. State where `b` is true:  
     `{a} → {a,b} → {a} → ...`  
     ▶ Fails at state 1: `b=true`.  
  3. State where both deviate:  
     `{} → {a} → ...`  
     ▶ Fails at state 0: `a=false`.  

#### Key Insight:  
This formula expresses an **invariant**: Properties `a` and `!b` must hold **eternally** without exception. It forbids any deviation at any time.
