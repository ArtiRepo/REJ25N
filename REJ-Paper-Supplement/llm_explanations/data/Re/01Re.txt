### Translation of LTL Formula: \( X  a \implies X  c \)

#### 1. **Breakdown of the Formula (Parsing Tree)**
- **Atomic propositions**:
  - `a`: Represents an atomic variable (e.g., "a holds" or "a is true").
  - `c`: Represents an atomic variable (e.g., "c holds" or "c is true").
- **Temporal operators**:
  - `X a`: "Next \(a\)" means "a is true in the immediate next state."
  - `X c`: "Next \(c\)" means "c is true in the immediate next state."
- **Logical operator**:
  - \(\implies\): Implication, meaning "if the left side is true, then the right side must be true."

**Parsing Tree**:
```
     =>
    /   \
   X     X
   |     |
   a     c
```

#### 2. **Rebuilding the Meaning (Bottom-Up)**:
1. **Base atoms**:
   - `a` holds if the system property "a" is true at a given time.
   - `c` holds if the system property "c" is true at a given time.
2. **Apply `X` (Next)**:
   - `X a`: "In the immediate next state from the current time, `a` must be true."
   - `X c`: "In the immediate next state from the current time, `c` must be true."
3. **Apply \(\implies\) (Implication)**:
   - \( X  a \implies X  c \) means "**If** (a is true in the next state), **then** (c is true in the next state)."
   - Logically, this holds unless `a` is true in the next state while `c` is **not** true in that same next state.

#### 3. **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**:
> **"If, in the next moment, a holds, then in that same next moment, c must hold."**

#### 4. **Key Constraints Over Time**:
- **Evaluated at the current time**: The formula only constrains the **immediate next state** relative to the current state.
- **No constraints elsewhere**:
  - The **current state** is unconstrained; `a` and `c` can be true/false arbitrarily.
  - All **states beyond the immediate next state** (e.g., 2 steps ahead) are unconstrained.
- **When satisfied vs. violated**:
  - **Satisfied** if in the next state:
    - `a` is false (the implication holds regardless of `c`), **OR**
    - `a` is true **and** `c` is true.
  - **Violated** only if `a` is true in the next state **and** `c` is false.

#### 5. **Example Sequences**:
- **Satisfying sequence** (current state at time `t=0`, next at `t=1`):
  - `({ }, {a, c}, ...)`: Next state has `a` and `c` → holds.  
  - `({a}, { }, ...)`: Next state has `a` false → implication holds (no requirement).  
  - `({c}, {a}, ...)`: **Violation!** Next state has `a` true but `c` false.  
- **Violating sequence**:
  - `({ }, {a}, ...)`: Next state has `a` true but `c` false → violates the implication.  

#### Summary:
The formula \( X  a \implies X  c \) **exclusively constrains the immediate next state** of the system:  
It demands that **if `a` becomes true in the next moment, `c` must also be true in that same moment**. It does not restrict the current state or any future states beyond the next one.
