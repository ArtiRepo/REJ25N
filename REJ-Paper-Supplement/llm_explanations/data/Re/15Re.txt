**Original LTL Formula:**  
`G a`

---

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Parse the formula into its components:**  
   - The formula consists of the **G operator** (which means "Globally") and the **atomic proposition `a`**.  
   - The parsing tree is:  
     ```  
        G  
        |  
        a  
     ```  

---

### Rebuilding the Meaning:

1. **Atomic proposition `a`**:  
   - Represents a basic condition in the system. If `a` is true at a given state, it means the system satisfies the condition encoded by `a` at that moment.  

2. **The `G` operator**:  
   - Applies to `a` (i.e., `G φ` means "**globally φ**").  
   - **Meaning**: `G a` requires `a` to hold **in the current state and every future state** along the system execution path.  

3. **Combined semantics of `G a`**:  
   > "`a` must be true for all states, starting now and continuing indefinitely."

### Refined Natural Language Explanation:
> The formula \( G \, a \) is satisfied if and only if **at every moment during the system execution, the condition `a` holds true**.  

---

### Constraints Over Time:
- **Scope of constraint**:  
  The formula enforces that `a` **must hold at every single time point**, from the current state (time \( t_0 \)) to infinity.
- **No exceptions**:  
  Even a single state where `a` fails immediately violates the entire formula. There is no future point at which `a` is allowed to be false.

### Satisfying vs. Violating Sequences:
- **Satisfying sequence example**:  
  \( \text{State}_{0}: \{a\},\quad \text{State}_{1}: \{a\},\quad \text{State}_{2}: \{a\},\quad \ldots \)  
  *(All states contain `a`)*.  
- **Violating sequence example**:  
  \( \text{State}_{0}: \{a\},\quad \text{State}_{1}: \{\text{(no } a)\},\quad \text{State}_{2}: \{a\},\quad \ldots \)  
  *(Fails because `a` is false at \( \text{State}_{1} \))*.  

---

### Final Translation:
> The condition \( a \) **must permanently hold throughout every moment of the system execution**.
