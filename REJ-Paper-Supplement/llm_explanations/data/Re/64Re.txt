### Translation of LTL Formula: G(a → XXXa)

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Original Formula**:  
   `G(a → XXXa)`

2. **Parsing Tree** (from innermost subformulas outward):
   - Innermost: `a` (atomic proposition "a holds at the current time").
   - `X(a)` = "a holds **one time step** later".
   - `XX(a)` = "a holds **two time steps** later".
   - `XXX(a)` = "a holds **three time steps** later".
   - Implications (`→`): `a → XXXa` = "If `a` holds **now**, then `XXXa` must hold".
   - Global (`G`): `G(a → XXXa)` = The implication must hold **for all time steps**.

3. **Rebuilding Meaning**:  
   - `XXXa` requires `a` to hold three time steps after the **current moment**.  
   - `a → XXXa` means: Whenever `a` is true now, it must **also be true three time steps later**.  
   - `G(...)` enforces that this rule holds **at every moment** in the execution.

4. **Refined Natural Language Translation**:  
   > **"Globally, whenever proposition `a` is true at some point in time, `a` must be true again exactly three time steps later."**

#### Key Constraints Over Time:
- **When evaluated**: At every time step `t` in the execution sequence.  
- **Constraint at time `t`**:  
  - **If** `a` is true at `t`, **then** `a` must be true at `t+3`.  
  - If `a` is false at `t`, no constraints are imposed (the implication holds trivially).  
- **Persistence requirement**: If `a` becomes true once, it must **repeat every three steps infinitely** (e.g., at `t`, `t+3`, `t+6`, ...).  
- **Domain**: Constrains **specific future points** (`t+3`) relative to every `t` where `a` is true. Entire execution must satisfy this pattern.

#### Satisfying vs. Violating Sequences:
- **✅ Satisfying Sequence** (periodic `a` with interval 3):  
  `(a), (), (), (a), (), (), (a), ...`  
  *Explanation*:  
  At `t=0` (`a` true) → `a` holds at `t=3` (required).  
  At `t=3` (`a` true) → `a` holds at `t=6` (required).  
  *Also valid*: `a` *always* true, or `a` *never* true.

- **❌ Violating Sequence**:  
  `(a), (a), (), (), (a), ...`  
  *Explanation*:  
  - At `t=0` (`a` true) → Requires `a` at `t=3`, but `t=3` has no `a` (violation).  
  *Alternatively*:  
  `(a), (), (), (), (a), ...`  
  - At `t=0` (`a` true) → Requires `a` at `t=3`, but `t=3` has no `a` (violation).

#### Final Translation:
> **"Throughout the entire execution, whenever `a` is true at a given moment, `a` must be true again exactly three moments later."**
