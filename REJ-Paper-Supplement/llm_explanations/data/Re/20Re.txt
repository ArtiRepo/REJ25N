### Reasoning for LTL Formula: **G t | F w**

#### Step 1: Original Formula  
`G t | F w`  
*(Operators: `G` = "Globally", `F` = "Finally", `|` = logical OR, `t`/`w` = atomic propositions)*  

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree (Breakdown)  
- **Top-level operator**: Disjunction (`|`), combining two subformulas:  
  1. **`G t`**  
     - `G` (Globally) applied to `t`.  
     - *Interpretation*: `t` must hold **at every future time point** (including now).  
  2. **`F w`**  
     - `F` (Finally) applied to `w`.  
     - *Interpretation*: `w` must hold **at some future time point** (including now).  

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning (Bottom-Up)  
1. **`G t` meaning**:  
   - "`t` is true **now and forever** for all future states."  
   - Example of violation: If `t` is false at **any future time**, `G t` fails.  

2. **`F w` meaning**:  
   - "`w` is true at **least once** in the future (now or later)."  
   - Example of violation: If `w` is **never true** in any future state, `F w` fails.  

3. **Combined with `|` (OR)**:  
   - The entire formula `G t | F w` holds if **at least one** subformula is true:  
     - Either `t` must be **true forever** (`G t` holds),  
     - Or `w` must be **true at least once** (`F w` holds),  
     - Or **both** conditions are satisfied.  

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Translation  
> "**Either `t` holds continuously from now into the infinite future, or `w` must occur at least once sometime in the future (or both).**"  

#### Key Constraints Over Time  
- **When satisfied**:  
  - If `t` remains **true forever** (even if `w` never occurs), the formula holds.  
  - If `w` occurs **at least once** (even if `t` eventually fails), the formula holds.  
  - If **both occur** (e.g., `t` holds forever and `w` occurs), the formula holds.  
- **When violated**:  
  - Only if **BOTH** conditions fail:  
    - `t` becomes false **at least once** in the future, **AND**  
    - `w` **never occurs** in any future state.  
- **Temporal scope**:  
  - `G t` constrains **all future states** indefinitely.  
  - `F w` constrains **at least one future state** (finite timing).  

#### Example Sequences  
- **Satisfying sequences**:  
  - `(t,w)`, `(t)`, `(t)`, `(t)`, ...  
    *(Reason: `G t` holds; `w` occurs initially but not required for `G t`.)*  
  - `()`, `(w)`, `()`, `()`, ...  
    *(Reason: `F w` holds at time 1; `t` is irrelevant.)*  
  - `(t,w)`, `(t,w)`, `(t)`, ...  
    *(Reason: Both `G t` and `F w` hold.)*  
- **Violating sequence**:  
  - `(t)`, `(t)`, `()`, `()`, ... `[t never true again, w never true]`  
    *(Reason: `t` fails at time 2 onward, and `w` never occurs → both disjuncts fail.)*  

### Final Translation  
"**Either `t` is always true from now on, or `w` must eventually become true (or both).**"
