### Translation of the LTL Formula: `!F (a & b)`

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Original Formula**:  
   `!F (a & b)`

2. **Parsing Tree Breakdown**:  
   - Atomic propositions: `a`, `b` (fundamental Boolean states).  
   - Conjunction: `a & b` (both `a` and `b` true **at the same time point**).  
   - Future operator: `F (a & b)` (`(a & b)` holds **at some future time point**, including the present).  
   - Negation: `!F (a & b)` (it is **never true** that `(a & b)` holds at any time point).  

3. **Rebuilding Meaning**:  
   - `a & b`: "`a` and `b` are both true **simultaneously** in a single state."  
   - `F (a & b)`: "**Eventually**, there is a time point where `a` and `b` are both true."  
   - `!F (a & b)`: This **negates** `F (a & b)`, meaning: "It is **never** the case that `a` and `b` are both true at the **same time point**."  

4. **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**:  
   "**`a` and `b` never occur simultaneously at any point in time.**"  

#### Key Insights:
- **When satisfied**:  
  The formula holds if `a` and `b` are **never both true** in the **entire timeline**. Examples:  
  - `a` true and `b` false at all times.  
  - `a` false and `b` true at all times.  
  - Both `a` and `b` false at all times.  
  - `a`/`b` toggle (e.g., `[a] → [b] → [a] → ...`), but **never in the same state**.  

- **When violated**:  
  The formula fails if **any state** has **both `a` and `b` true**. Examples:  
  - `a` and `b` true at the initial state.  
  - `a` and `b` true at a later state (e.g., `[a] → [a,b] → ...` violates at the second state).  

- **Constraints Over Time**:  
  This is a **global constraint**. It applies to **every time point** in the system’s execution, prohibiting **any overlap** of `a` and `b`. No restrictions are imposed on individual occurrences of `a` or `b` alone.  

#### Example Sequences:
- **Satisfying Sequence**:  
  `(a), (), (b), (a), (b), ...`  
  *(Reason: `a` and `b` never true together.)*  
- **Violating Sequence**:  
  `(a), (a,b), (b), ...`  
  *(Reason: `a` and `b` co-occur in the second state.)*  

### Final Translation:
**"`a` and `b` must never both be true at the same time."**
