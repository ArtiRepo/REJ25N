**Original LTL Formula:**  
\( b \, \text{U} \, (d \land a) \)

**Parsing Tree:**  
1. **Root Operator:** `U` (Until)  
   - **Left Child:** Atomic proposition \( b \)  
   - **Right Child:** Binary operator \( \land \) (And)  
     - **Left Grandchild:** Atomic proposition \( d \)  
     - **Right Grandchild:** Atomic proposition \( a \)  

**Step-by-Step Rebuilding of Meaning:**  
1. **Innermost Subformula (Atomics):**  
   - \( d \) means "\( d \) holds (is true) in the current state."  
   - \( a \) means "\( a \) holds in the current state."  

2. **Conjunction (\( d \land a \)):**  
   - "\( d \) and \( a \) **both hold simultaneously** in the current state."  

3. **Until Operator (\( b \, \text{U} \, (d \land a) \)):**  
   - The formula asserts that:  
     - **Eventually**, a state must occur where \( d \land a \) is true.  
     - **Until that state is reached**, \( b \) must hold **at every preceding state** (including the current state if \( d \land a \) is not true immediately).  
   - Critical detail: At the exact state where \( d \land a \) becomes true, \( b \) **does not need to hold** (constraints end just before this state).  

**Refined Natural Language Translation:**  
> "**Eventually, both \( d \) and \( a \) must be true simultaneously, and \( b \) must hold continuously from now until immediately before that state occurs.**"  

**Key Constraints Over Time:**  
- **Eventuality Constraint:** A state where \( d \land a \) is true **must occur** at some future (or current) time.  
- **Continuous Requirement:** If \( d \land a \) is not immediately true, then:  
  - \( b \) must be true starting **from the current state**,  
  - and remain true through **every subsequent state**,  
  - **up to (but excluding)** the first state where \( d \land a \) is true.  
- **No Constraint Beyond:**  
  - After \( d \land a \) becomes true, \( b \) can behave arbitrarily (it can be true or false).  
  - If \( d \land a \) is true now, \( b \) has **no constraints** (the "until" interval is empty).  

**Satisfying and Violating Sequences:**  
- **Satisfying Sequence Example:**  
  \(\langle \{\}, \{b\}, \{b\}, \{d, a\}, \{b\}, \dots \rangle\)  
  - *Explanation:* \( b \) holds in states 1 and 2 (preceding the \( d \land a \) state), and \( d \land a \) becomes true at state 3.  
- **Violating Sequence Example:**  
  \(\langle \{\}, \{b\}, \{\}, \{d, a\}, \dots \rangle\)  
  - *Reason:* \( b \) fails in state 2 (the state immediately before \( d \land a \) occurs at state 3).  
  \(\langle \{\}, \{b\}, \{b\}, \{b\}, \dots \rangle\)   (where \( d \land a \) never occurs)  
  - *Reason:* The eventuality \( d \land a \) is never satisfied.  

**Why This Translation?**  
The phrasing explicitly separates:  
- The **eventuality requirement** (mandating \( d \land a \) occurs),  
- The **continuous requirement** (ensuring \( b \) holds exclusively **until the moment before** \( d \land a \) becomes true).  
This aligns perfectly with LTL’s "strong until" semantics (\(\varphi \text{U} \psi\) requires \(\psi\) occurs and \(\varphi\) holds until just before that state).
