### Translation of LTL Formula: **Fa → Gb**  
**Original LTL Formula:**  
`Fa → Gb`

### Step-by-Step Parsing and Meaning Reconstruction  
#### Parsing Tree Breakdown:  
1. **Atomic propositions**:  
   - `a` and `b` are atomic variables (e.g., system states or events).  
2. **Temporal operators**:  
   - `F` (Eventually): `Fa` means "a is true at some future time."  
   - `G` (Globally): `Gb` means "b is true at **every** future time."  
3. **Logical operator**:  
   - `→` (Implication): `Fa → Gb` means "**if** Fa holds, **then** Gb must hold."  

#### Rebuilding Meaning from Tree:  
- **Leaf 1: `Fa`**  
  - "At least once in the future (including now), `a` becomes true."  
- **Leaf 2: `Gb`**  
  - "From the current state onward, `b` is **always** true (for all future moments)."  
- **Operator `→` (Implication)**:  
  - **If** there exists a future time where `a` is true, **then** `b` must hold:  
    - At **every** moment starting from **now**, **and**  
    - For **all** time points after the current state.  

#### Refined Natural Language Phrasing:  
> "**If `a` ever becomes true in the future (from now onward), then `b` must hold from the current state onward and forever.**"

### Key Constraints Over Time  
- **Activation of Constraint**:  
  - If `a` **never** holds in the future, the implication is **vacuously true** (no constraint on `b` at any time).  
  - If `a` holds **at least once** (now or later), `b` **must be true**:  
    - At the **current state**,  
    - At **all times before `a` occurs** (if it occurs later),  
    - At the **time `a` occurs**, **and**  
    - For **all future times indefinitely**.  
- **Scope**:  
  - Constrains the **entire future** from the current state onward.

### Satisfying vs. Violating Trace Examples  
- **Satisfying Trace** (formula true):  
  - `({a=False, b=True}, {a=True, b=True}, {a=False, b=True}, ...)`  
  - **Why**: `a` occurs at time 2 → `b` holds **from time 1 onward** (G true).  
- **Violating Trace** (formula false):  
  - `({a=False, b=False}, {a=True, b=True}, {a=False, b=True}, ...)`  
  - **Why**: `a` occurs at time 2, but `b` fails at time 1 → violates "`b` must hold **from now onward**."  

---

### Summary of Semantics  
- The formula imposes a **global requirement on `b`** only **if** `a` appears in the future.  
- **Violation occurs if**:  
  - `a` holds at **any future time**, and  
  - `b` is **false at any time** (now or later).
