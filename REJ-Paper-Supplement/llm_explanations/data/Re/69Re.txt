### Translation of LTL Formula: **FGa**

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Original LTL Formula**:  
   `FGa`  
   *(Note: This is parsed as `F(G a)`, where `a` is an atomic variable/proposition.)*

2. **Parsing Tree (Breakdown)**:  
   ```
     F    (Eventually operator)
      \
       G   (Globally/Always operator)
        \
         a  (Atomic variable; `a` is true at a given state)
   ```
   - **Leaf node**: `a`  
     Represents the proposition that "*`a` is true at a specific moment*."  
   - **Operator `G` (Globally)**: Applied to `a` → `G a`  
     Means "*`a` is true at every future state, starting now*."  
   - **Operator `F` (Eventually)**: Applied to `G a` → `F(G a)`  
     Means "*Eventually (at some future state), `G a` becomes true*."  

3. **Rebuilding the Meaning**:  
   - `G a` requires that *from some future state onward* (`t = k`), `a` must hold **in all subsequent states** (`t = k, k+1, k+2, ...`).  
   - `F(G a)` requires that *there exists at least one future state* (`t = k`) where this perpetual truth of `a` begins.  
   - Thus, `FGa` means:  
     > **"There exists a future state from which `a` is always true."**  

4. **Constraints Over Time**:  
   - **No initial constraint**: `a` need not hold at the start (or early states).  
   - **Critical future point**: At least one state `k` must exist where:  
     - `a` is true at `k`,  
     - And `a` remains true **forever after** `k`.  
   - **After `k`**: Violations (e.g., `¬a`) in states *before* `k` do not break satisfaction, but **any violation after `k` violates the formula**.  

5. **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**:  
   > **"Eventually, `a` becomes permanently true."**  
   *(i.e., `a` eventually stabilizes to true and remains so forever.)*

#### Examples:
- **Satisfying Sequences**:  
  - `(¬a), (¬a), (a), (a), (a), ...`  
    *(`a` becomes true at state 2 and stays true forever.)*  
  - `(a), (a), (a), ...`  
    *(`a` is true from the start → stabilizes immediately.)*  

- **Violating Sequences**:  
  - `(a), (¬a), (a), (¬a), ...`  
    *(No future state triggers perpetual `a`; `a` oscillates forever.)*  
  - `(¬a), (¬a), (¬a), ...`  
    *(`a` never becomes true → no state where perpetual truth begins.)*  

---

#### Key Notes:
- **F is reached**: The formula is satisfied **as soon as** `a` becomes true forever. Earlier failures are irrelevant.  
- **G constrains "forever after"**: Once `a` stabilizes, **no future exceptions** are allowed.  
- **Distinct from similar formulas**:  
  - `F a` = "*`a` holds at least once*" (no continuity required).  
  - `G a` = "*`a` holds in every state*" (from the start).  
  - `FGa` = "*`a` eventually stabilizes to true forever*" (stronger than `F a`, weaker than `G a`).
