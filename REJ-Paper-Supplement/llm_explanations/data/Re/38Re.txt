**Original LTL Formula:**  
`(a U b) & (c U d)`

---

### Step 1: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
The formula can be hierarchically broken down into a tree structure:  
```
        &
       /   \
      U     U
     / \   / \
    a   b c   d
```  
- **Atomic propositions**: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` (declarations about states).  
- **Operator `U` (Until)**:  
  - Left branch: `a U b` ("`a` holds *until* `b` eventually becomes true").  
  - Right branch: `c U d` ("`c` holds *until* `d` eventually becomes true").  
- **Operator `&` (Conjunction)**: Both `a U b` and `c U d` must hold simultaneously.  

---

### Step 2: Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up  
1. **Atomic Propositions**:  
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` represent Boolean properties (e.g., "a sensor is active").  

2. **`a U b` (Until operator)**:  
   - *Meaning*:  
     - There exists a future state where `b` becomes true.  
     - From now **until** that state, `a` *must* hold in every intermediate state.  
     - `b` **must eventually occur**.  

3. **`c U d` (Until operator)**:  
   - *Meaning*:  
     - There exists a future state where `d` becomes true.  
     - From now **until** that state, `c` *must* hold in every intermediate state.  
     - `d` **must eventually occur**.  

4. **`&` (Conjunction)**:  
   - Both `a U b` and `c U d` must be satisfied **together**.  
   - The timelines for these conditions are **independent**:  
     - `b` and `d` can occur at different times.  
     - Constraints for `a` and `c` persist *only* until `b` and `d` become true, respectively.  

---

### Step 3: Constraints Over Time  
- **Satisfaction at time `t=0`** (current state) requires:  
  1. `a` **must hold** from `t=0` **until** some future moment `t_b` where `b` becomes true (at `t_b`).  
  2. `c` **must hold** from `t=0` **until** some future moment `t_d` where `d` becomes true (at `t_d`).  
- **Key properties**:  
  - **Eventuality**: Both `b` and `d` **must eventually occur** (the system cannot delay them forever).  
  - **Continuity**:  
    - `a` cannot be false *before* `b` occurs.  
    - `c` cannot be false *before* `d` occurs.  
  - **Independence**:  
    - `t_b` (when `b` occurs) and `t_d` (when `d` occurs) **can be at different times** (e.g., `b` occurs first, followed by `d`, or vice versa).  
    - No constraints on `a` after `b` occurs.  
    - No constraints on `c` after `d` occurs.

### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Phrasing  
> "The system must satisfy two conditions:  
> (1) **`a` holds continuously until `b` becomes true, and `b` must eventually occur**;  
> (2) **`c` holds continuously until `d` becomes true, and `d` must eventually occur**.  
> These conditions operate independently—`b` and `d` may occur at different times, and constraints on `a`/`c` cease once `b`/`d` (respectively) happen."  

---

### Examples  
- **Satisfying Traces** (starting from `t=0`):  
  - `(a,c), (a,c), (b,c), (b,d)`:  
    - `a` holds until `t=2` (when `b` occurs).  
    - `c` holds until `t=3` (when `d` occurs).  
  - `(a,c), (a,d), (b,d)`:  
    - `a` holds until `t=2` (when `b` occurs) at `t=2`.  
    - `c` holds until `t=1` (when `d` occurs) at `t=1` (`d` occurs before `b`).  

- **Violating Traces**:  
  - `(a,c), (a,c), (a,c), ...` (infinite):  
    - `b` and `d` never occur → violates **eventuality**.  
  - `(a,c), (¬a,c), (b,d)`:  
    - `a` fails at `t=1` *before* `b` occurs → violates `a U b`.  
  - `(a,¬c), (a,¬c), (b,d)`:  
    - `c` is false at `t=0` and `t=1` *before* `d` occurs → violates `c U d`.

**Final Translation:**  
> **"Eventually (and independently), `b` must become true with `a` holding until then, and `d` must become true with `c` holding until then."**
