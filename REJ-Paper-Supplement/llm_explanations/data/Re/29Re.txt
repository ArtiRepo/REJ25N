### Translation of the LTL Formula: F x | F y

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Original Formula**:  
   `F x | F y`

2. **Parsing Tree (Breakdown)**:  
   - The top-level operator is a disjunction (`|`, meaning "or").  
   - The left subformula is `F x` (`F` = "eventually").  
   - The right subformula is `F y` (`F` = "eventually").  

   **Parsing Tree Structure**:  
   ```
      |  
     / \  
    F   F  
    |   |  
    x   y  
   ```

3. **Rebuild Meaning from Bottom Up**:  
   - **Atomic variables**:  
     - `x` indicates "the system satisfies property `x`."  
     - `y` indicates "the system satisfies property `y`."  
   - **Subformula `F x`**:  
     - "Eventually (at some point in the future), `x` must hold."  
   - **Subformula `F y`**:  
     - "Eventually (at some point in the future), `y` must hold."  
   - **Disjunction (`|`)**:  
     - The formula requires **at least one** of these subformulas to hold:  
       "Either `F x` is true, or `F y` is true, or both."  

   **Combined Meaning**:  
   "Eventually, `x` becomes true, or eventually, `y` becomes true, **or both**—with no requirement on *when* or *in which order*."  

4. **Constraints Over Time**:  
   - **Satisfying Condition**:  
     The formula is satisfied if:  
     - `x` becomes true **at any future state** (even immediately), *or*  
     - `y` becomes true **at any future state** (even immediately), *or*  
     - **Both** occur (any combination of future times).  
     - *Note*: "Future" includes the current state. If `x` or `y` is true *now*, the formula holds.  
   - **Violating Condition**:  
     The formula is violated **only if** both `x` and `y` **remain false forever** from the current state onward.  
   - **No Constraints On**:  
     - The relative timing of `x` and `y` (either can happen first, both simultaneously, or only one).  
     - The current state values if neither is currently true (they may be false now).  
     - How many times `x` or `y` become true (a single occurrence suffices indefinitely).  

5. **Satisfying vs. Violating Sequences**:  
   - **Satisfying Sequences** (examples):  
     - `({x}, {}, {}, ...)` → `x` is true now, so `F x` holds.  
     - `({}, {y}, {}, ...)` → `y` becomes true at the next state.  
     - `({}, {}, {x}, ...)` → `x` becomes true after two states.  
     - `({x,y}, {}, ...)` → Both true now (redundant but valid).  
   - **Violating Sequence** (example):  
     `({}, {}, {}, ...)` → All states defined only by letters *other than `x` or `y`* (e.g., `a`, `b`, etc.). If `x` and `y` are **never** true from the starting point onward, the formula fails.

### Final Natural Language Translation:  
> **"Eventually, either `x` holds or `y` holds (or both), at least once in the future."**  

#### Key Clarifications:  
- "Eventually" includes the **present state** onward.  
- The formula **does not specify** *when* or *in what order* `x` or `y` become true, only that **at least one is guaranteed to occur**.  
- It fails **only if** both `x` and `y` are **eternally absent** from the current point forward.
