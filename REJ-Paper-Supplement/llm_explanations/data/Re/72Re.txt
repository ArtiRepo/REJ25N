### Translation and Explanation for LTL Formula: **G !a**

#### 1. **Original LTL Formula**:  
   `G !a`

#### 2. **Parsing Tree Breakdown**:
   - **Leaf node**: `a` (atomic proposition; `a` is true in a state).  
   - **Negation operator (`!`)**: Applied to `a`, forming `!a` (`a` is **false** in a state).  
   - **Global/temporal operator (`G`)**: Applied to `!a`, forming `G !a` (`!a` holds **in all states**).  
   ```
        G
        |
        !
        |
        a
   ```

#### 3. **Rebuild Meaning (Bottom-Up)**:
   - `a`: "The atomic proposition `a` is true."  
   - `!a`: **"`a` is false"** (logical negation).  
   - `G !a`: **"`a` is false in every state of the execution, including the present and all future states."**  
     (The `G` operator enforces that `!a` holds **globally**.)

#### 4. **Constraints Over Time**:  
   - **Applies to all time points**:  
     The formula requires `a` to be **false** in **every state** of the system execution, starting from the initial state and continuing indefinitely.  
   - **No time point is exempt**:  
     If `a` becomes true in **any state** (even one state), the formula is violated.  
   - **Scope**: Constraints apply to the **entire timeline** (infinitely into the future).

#### 5. **Satisfying vs. Violating Sequences**:
   - **Satisfying trace** (holds globally):  
     `{}, {b}, {c}, {} ...`  
     - `a` is **never** true in any state.  
   - **Violating trace** (fails at some point):  
     `{}, {a}, {b}, ...`  
     - Violation occurs at the second state (where `a` is true).  
     `{a}, {b}, {c}, ...`  
     - Violation occurs at the initial state (where `a` is true).  

#### 6. **Natural Language Translation**:  
> "Throughout the entire system execution, `a` must never hold (be true)."  

### Key Clarifications:
- **"Globally"** emphasizes the constraint applies **everywhere** in time (no exceptions).  
- **"Never"** explicitly forbids `a` from being true in **any** state.  

**Final Translation**:  
> **"Globally, `a` is never true."**
