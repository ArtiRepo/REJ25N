## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: G (j => !f)

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- G (Globally, or Always)
- j (a proposition, let's call it "j is true")
- => (implies)
- !f (not f, where f is another proposition, let's call it "f is false")

The parsing tree can be seen as:
```
     G
   /   \
  j    !f
   \   /
    =>
```

However, a more accurate representation for parsing would consider the implication first:
```
     G
    / 
   =>
  /   \
 j     !f
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- !f means "f is false".
- j => !f means "if j then f is false". In other words, whenever j is true, f must be false. If j is false, there's no restriction on f.

## 4: Apply the G operator
- G (j => !f) means "Globally, if j then f is false". This implies that at all times, whenever j is true, f must be false. It does not restrict f when j is false.

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula G (j => !f) can be translated to: "It is always the case that if j happens, then f does not happen."

## 6: Explain satisfaction and constraints
- The formula is satisfied if, at every point in time, either j is false or f is false (or both).
- It imposes a constraint on the system that whenever j becomes true, f must immediately become false (or remain false if it's already false) and this condition must hold forever.

The final answer is: $\boxed{It is always the case that if j happens, then f does not happen.}$
