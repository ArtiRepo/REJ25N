## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: F !b

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To parse the formula F !b, we break it down into its components:
- F: "Future" or "Eventually" operator, which means that a condition will be true at some point in the future.
- !b: Negation of b, which means "not b" or "b is false".

So, the parsing tree can be seen as:
- Root: F
  - Child: !b

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- !b means "b is false" or "b does not hold".
- F (!b) means "Eventually, b will be false" or "At some point in the future, b will not hold".

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula F !b can be translated to natural language as: "It will eventually be the case that b is false" or more simply, "b will be false at some point in the future".

This means the system will reach a state where b is not true at some future point in time. It does not specify when this will happen, just that it will happen.

The final answer is: $\boxed{b will be false at some point in the future}$
