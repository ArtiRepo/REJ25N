## Step 1: Write down original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: $a \rightarrow XXXa$

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- $a$ is an atomic proposition.
- $\rightarrow$ is the implication operator.
- $XXXa$ represents a temporal operator "X" applied three times to $a$, meaning $a$ must be true three time steps in the future.

The parsing tree can be represented as:
```
  →
 /   \
a     XXXa
       |
       X
      / \
     X   a
    /
     X
```

However, a more accurate representation directly reflects the structure of the formula:
```
  →
 /   \
a     X(X(Xa))
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $Xa$ means $a$ is true in the next state.
- $XXa = X(Xa)$ means $a$ is true two steps from now.
- $XXXa = X(X(Xa))$ means $a$ is true three steps from now.

The implication $a \rightarrow XXXa$ means that if $a$ is true, then $a$ must be true three steps later.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula $a \rightarrow XXXa$ can be translated to: "If $a$ is true, then $a$ will be true three time steps later."

This implies that whenever $a$ occurs, the system must ensure that $a$ occurs again three steps after that. If $a$ is not true, there is no constraint imposed by this formula on the system regarding $a$'s truth value in the future.

## 5: Final Translation and Explanation
The LTL formula $a \rightarrow XXXa$ essentially constrains the system such that if $a$ happens to be true at some point, the system must have $a$ true three steps after that point as well. It does not restrict the behavior of the system if $a$ is false; in such cases, the implication is vacuously true.

The final answer is: $\boxed{If a is true, then a will be true three time steps later.}$
