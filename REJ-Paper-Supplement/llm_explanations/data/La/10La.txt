## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: $(d | !b) U !a$

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- The formula is: $(d | !b) U !a$
- The main operator is $U$ (Until).
- The left operand of $U$ is: $d | !b$
  - This is a disjunction (OR), with operands $d$ and $!b$.
- The right operand of $U$ is: $!a$

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $!b$ means "$b$ is false" or "$b$ does not hold".
- $d$ means "$d$ holds".
- $d | !b$ means "$d$ holds or $b$ is false". This is true if either $d$ is true or $b$ is false (or both).
- $!a$ means "$a$ is false" or "$a$ does not hold".

## 4: Understanding the $U$ (Until) operator
The $U$ operator has the following meaning: $p U q$ is true if $p$ holds until $q$ holds. More precisely, it is true if:
- $q$ will eventually hold (at some point in the future).
- $p$ holds at least until $q$ holds (it can hold longer, but it must hold at least until $q$ becomes true).

## 5: Combine the meanings to understand the whole formula
Combining these meanings:
- $(d | !b) U !a$ means that "$d$ or not $b$ holds until $a$ does not hold".
- For this formula to be satisfied, two conditions must be met:
  1. $a$ must eventually become false (i.e., $!a$ must become true at some point).
  2. Until $a$ becomes false, $d$ or not $b$ (or both) must hold.

## 6: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Refining the natural language phrasing:
- The system must be in a state where either $d$ is true or $b$ is false (or both) at least until the point when $a$ becomes false.
- Once $a$ becomes false, the condition is satisfied regardless of the states of $b$ and $d$ after that point.

## 7: Final Translation
A natural language translation of the LTL formula $(d | !b) U !a$ could be:
"The system must satisfy that either $d$ is true or $b$ is false (or both) at least until $a$ becomes false."

The final answer is: $\boxed{(d \lor \neg b) \text{ holds until } a \text{ becomes false}}$
