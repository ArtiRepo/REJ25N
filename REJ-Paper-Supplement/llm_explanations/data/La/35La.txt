## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: F (f => j)

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula F (f => j), we first identify its components:
- F: "Eventually" or "Future", a temporal operator indicating that something will happen at some point in the future.
- f => j: An implication where "f" implies "j". In LTL, "f" and "j" are propositions that can be true or false at any given time.

The parsing tree can be seen as:
```
     F
    /   \
  (     )
 /       \
f        =>
       /   \
      f     j
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- f and j are propositions. Let's say "f" means "the system fails" and "j" means "the system is in a recovery state" or any suitable interpretation based on context.
- f => j means "if the system fails, then it is in a recovery state". This implication is false only when f is true and j is false.
- The operator F before the implication means that "eventually" the implication f => j will be true.

## 4: Interpret the meaning of F (f => j)
The formula F (f => j) means that eventually, whenever the system fails (f), it will be in a recovery state (j). It does not require that the system fails immediately or at all, but it does require that if and when it does fail, it will eventually recover.

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
A clear natural language translation could be: "Eventually, if the system fails, it will enter a recovery state."

Or, more formally: "It will be the case that at some point in the future, whenever the system fails, it will be in a recovery state."

This phrasing captures the essence of the LTL formula, emphasizing that there is no immediate requirement for the system to fail or recover, but there is a future requirement that if failure occurs, recovery must follow.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Eventually, if the system fails, it will enter a recovery state.}$
