## Step 1: Write down original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: `!X !(w | x)`

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- `w` and `x` are atomic propositions.
- `|` represents disjunction (OR).
- `!` represents negation (NOT).
- `X` represents the next-time operator, which applies to the proposition that follows it, indicating that the property must hold in the next state.

The parsing tree breaks down as follows:
```
      !
     / 
    X 
   / 
  !
 / \
w   x
```

However, to accurately represent the given formula `!X !(w | x)`, the correct parsing should reflect the operator precedence and grouping:
```
  !
 / 
X 
\ 
  !
   / \
  |   (implicit grouping for clarity)
 / \
w   x
```
Or more accurately in terms of LTL syntax and semantics:
1. `w | x` is evaluated first (disjunction).
2. The result of `w | x` is then negated by `!`.
3. The result of `!(w | x)` is then preceded by `X`.
4. Finally, the entire expression `X !(w | x)` is negated by the outermost `!`.

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- `w | x` is true if either `w` or `x` (or both) are true.
- `!(w | x)` is true if both `w` and `x` are false. This is because the negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations (De Morgan's laws), so `!(w | x)` is equivalent to `!w & !x`.
- `X !(w | x)` means that in the next state, both `w` and `x` must be false.
- The outermost `!` negates this, so `!X !(w | x)` means it is not the case that in the next state, both `w` and `x` are false.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Given the meaning derived:
- `!X !(w | x)` can be translated to: "It is not the case that in the next state, neither `w` nor `x` holds."
- More naturally, this can be phrased as: "In the next state, it is not required that both `w` and `x` are false," or simply, "In the next state, at least one of `w` or `x` must be true."

The final answer is: $\boxed{In the next state, at least one of w or x must be true.}$
