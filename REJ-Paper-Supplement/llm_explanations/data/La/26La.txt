## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: $X t \Rightarrow X y$.

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To parse the formula, we break it down into its components:
- $t$ and $y$ are atomic propositions.
- $X$ is the next-time operator, which means "in the next state".
- $\Rightarrow$ is the implication operator.

The parsing tree can be represented as:
- Root: $\Rightarrow$
  - Left child: $X t$
    - $X$ (operator)
    - $t$ (atomic proposition)
  - Right child: $X y$
    - $X$ (operator)
    - $y$ (atomic proposition)

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $t$ and $y$ are statements that can be true or false at any given state.
- $X t$ means that $t$ is true in the next state.
- $X y$ means that $y$ is true in the next state.
- The implication $\Rightarrow$ between $X t$ and $X y$ means that if $X t$ is true, then $X y$ must also be true.

## 4: Interpret the implication in the context of LTL
In LTL, $X t \Rightarrow X y$ means that at any point in time, if $t$ is true in the next state, then $y$ must also be true in the next state. It does not impose any direct constraint on the current state but imposes a constraint on the next state based on the next state's properties.

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula $X t \Rightarrow X y$ can be translated to natural language as: "If $t$ is true in the next state, then $y$ must be true in the next state."

Or more idiomatically: "Whenever $t$ becomes true, $y$ must become true at the same time."

However, for strict accuracy in representing the LTL semantics:
- The formula does not require $t$ or $y$ to ever be true; it only specifies a relationship between them if $t$ is true in some next state.
- It does not directly relate the current state to the next state in terms of $t$ and $y$ being true; it's about the implication across successive states.

## 6: Final Translation
A clear and accurate translation is: "If $t$ holds in the next state, then $y$ must hold in the next state as well."

The final answer is: $\boxed{If $t$ holds in the next state, then $y$ must hold in the next state as well.}$
