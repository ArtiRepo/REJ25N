## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: X (f & i)

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- X: "Next" operator, indicating that the property it precedes holds in the next state.
- f: A propositional variable, representing a condition or property.
- i: Another propositional variable, representing another condition or property.
- &: Conjunction operator, meaning "and".

The parsing tree breaks down as follows:
```
     X
    / \
   f   i
    \ /
     &
```

However, a more accurate representation for parsing would reflect the structure as:
```
  X
 /   \
(     )
  |  &
  / \ 
 f   i
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- f and i are conditions that must both be true.
- The conjunction (&) between f and i means both must be satisfied simultaneously.
- The operator X before (f & i) means that the satisfaction of both f and i simultaneously must occur in the next state.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Given the breakdown and understanding:
- "f and i" means both conditions f and i must be true.
- "In the next state" (due to X) means we are looking at the conditions being satisfied in the state that immediately follows the current one.

Therefore, the LTL formula X (f & i) translates to: "In the next state, both f and i are true."

Or, in a more natural phrasing: "It will be the case that both f and i are true in the next state."

This implies that the system must transition into a state where both conditions f and i are satisfied in the immediate next step. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{In the next state, both f and i are true.}$
