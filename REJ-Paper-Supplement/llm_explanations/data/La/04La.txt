## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: $b | !X a$

## Step 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula $b | !X a$, we identify its components:
- $b$ is a proposition.
- $!$ denotes negation.
- $X$ denotes the next state operator.
- $a$ is a proposition.
- $|$ denotes disjunction (OR).

So, the parsing tree can be seen as:
- Root: $b | ...$
  - Left child: $b$
  - Right child: $!X a$
    - Child: $X a$
      - Child: $a$ (proposition)
    - Operator: $!$ (negation)

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $a$ being true in some state.
- $X a$ means $a$ is true in the next state.
- $!X a$ means it is not the case that $a$ is true in the next state, or equivalently, $a$ is false in the next state.
- $b$ being true in the current state satisfies the left side of the disjunction directly.

## 4: Combine the meanings with the logical operators
The formula $b | !X a$ is satisfied if:
- $b$ is true in the current state, regardless of the truth value of $a$ in the next state.
- Or, if $b$ is false in the current state, then $!X a$ must be true, meaning $a$ must be false in the next state.

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The natural language translation can be: "Either $b$ is true now, or $a$ will be false in the next state."

This phrasing captures the essence of the LTL formula $b | !X a$, conveying that the system satisfies the condition if either $b$ holds currently or if $a$ does not hold in the immediate future.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Either $b$ is true now, or $a$ will be false in the next state.}$
