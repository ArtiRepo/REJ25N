## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: G((a and Xa) -> XX!a)

## Step 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- The outermost operator is G (always).
- The inner formula is (a and Xa) -> XX!a.
- Further breaking down:
  - a is a proposition.
  - Xa means a in the next state.
  - !a means not a.
  - XX!a means not a in the state after next.

## 3: Detailed breakdown
- The formula can be seen as: G( InnerFormula )
- InnerFormula = (a and Xa) -> XX!a
- InnerFormula is an implication: Antecedent -> Consequent
  - Antecedent = a and Xa
  - Consequent = XX!a

## 4: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
- a: The proposition a is true.
- Xa: The proposition a is true in the next state.
- a and Xa: Both a and Xa are true, meaning a is true now and in the next state.
- !a: The proposition a is false.
- XX!a: The proposition a is false in the state after next.
- (a and Xa) -> XX!a: If a is true now and in the next state, then a must be false in the state after next.

## 5: Incorporate the G operator
- G((a and Xa) -> XX!a): Always, if a is true now and in the next state, then a must be false in the state after next.

## 6: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
- The system always satisfies the condition that if a is true in the current and next states, then a must become false two states from now.
- Alternatively, once a is true and remains true for one step, it must become false in the next step after that.

## 7: Final Translation
The LTL formula G((a and Xa) -> XX!a) translates to: "It is always the case that if a is true in the current state and the next state, then a must be false two states from now."

The final answer is: $\boxed{It is always the case that if a is true in the current state and the next state, then a must be false two states from now.}$
