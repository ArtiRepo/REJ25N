## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: F (o U u)

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula F (o U u), we identify its components:
- F: "Eventually" or "Future"
- o: A proposition (statement) that can be true or false
- U: "Until"
- u: Another proposition that can be true or false

The parsing tree can be represented as:
```
    F
   / 
  (o U u)
 /     \
o       u
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- o and u are propositions that can independently be true (T) or false (F) at any given time.
- o U u means "o Until u". This is satisfied if o is true and u is false until u becomes true. More precisely, it is satisfied if there exists a point in time where u becomes true and at all previous times o was true. If u never becomes true, then o U u is never satisfied.
- F (o U u) means "Eventually (o Until u)". This adds a layer of temporality, indicating that at some point in the future, the condition o U u will be satisfied.

## 4: Determine satisfaction conditions
F (o U u) is satisfied if there exists a time step in the future where o U u holds. This happens under two conditions:
1. There exists a point in time where u is true, and at all previous points in time, o has been true.
2. If u never becomes true, then for F (o U u) to be true, o must remain true indefinitely because there's no u to "stop" the condition.

However, the correct interpretation is more nuanced:
- The formula F (o U u) is satisfied if, at some point in the future, u starts being true and from that point backwards, o has always been true. If u never becomes true, o U u is never satisfied, but F (o U u) can still be satisfied if o is true from the start and remains true indefinitely.

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
A natural language translation could be: "Eventually, o will be true until u becomes true."

However, to accurately capture the meaning:
- "It will eventually be the case that o remains true until u becomes true."
- Alternatively, "At some point in the future, u will be true, and o will have been true up until then."

This captures the essence that there will be a future point where u's truth marks the end of a period during which o has been consistently true.

## 6: Final Clarification
The formula imposes a constraint on the system over time: it requires that at some future point, u must become true, and prior to that, o must have been true. If o is not true before u becomes true, or if u never becomes true while o is true, the formula is not satisfied.

The final answer is: $\boxed{It will eventually be the case that o remains true until u becomes true.}$
