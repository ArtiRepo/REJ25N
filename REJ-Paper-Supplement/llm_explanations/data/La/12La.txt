## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: $b U (a | d)$.

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- The formula is $b U (a | d)$.
- $b$ is a proposition.
- $U$ denotes "until".
- $a$ and $d$ are propositions.
- $|$ denotes "or".

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $a | d$ means "$a$ or $d$" - at least one of $a$ or $d$ must be true.
- The $U$ operator means "until". So, $b U (a | d)$ means that $b$ must be true until $a | d$ becomes true.

## 4: Detailed meaning of $b U (a | d)$
For $b U (a | d)$ to be satisfied:
- $b$ must hold true from the current time point onwards until the time point when $a | d$ becomes true.
- At some point in the future, $a | d$ must become true. This means either $a$ or $d$ (or both) must become true.

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula $b U (a | d)$ can be translated to natural language as: "$b$ must be true until $a$ or $d$ becomes true".

## 6: Constraints on the system over time
This formula imposes the following constraints on the system:
- $b$ must be continuously true until the condition $a | d$ is met.
- The condition $a | d$ must eventually be met, meaning the system must transition into a state where either $a$ or $d$ (or both) is true.

## 7: Final Translation
The LTL formula $b U (a | d)$ translates to: "$b$ holds continuously until $a$ or $d$ becomes true, and $a$ or $d$ will eventually become true".

The final answer is: $\boxed{b must hold until a or d becomes true}$
