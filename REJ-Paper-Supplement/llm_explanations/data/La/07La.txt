## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: $a U c$

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
The parsing tree for $a U c$ breaks down into:
- $a$ and $c$ as atomic propositions
- $U$ as the until operator

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $a$ means that proposition $a$ is true.
- $c$ means that proposition $c$ is true.
- The $U$ operator between $a$ and $c$, denoted as $a U c$, means that $a$ is true until $c$ becomes true.

## 4: Interpret the until operator ($U$) in LTL
In LTL, $a U c$ is satisfied if and only if:
- $a$ is true from the current time point onwards until $c$ becomes true, and
- $c$ eventually becomes true.

This means that for $a U c$ to be true, $a$ must hold continuously from the start until $c$ starts being true, at which point the condition $a U c$ is satisfied if $c$ remains true thereafter or if it's the point where $a$ stops being required.

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The natural language translation of $a U c$ can be: "$a$ is true until $c$ becomes true." This captures the essence that $a$ must be true at least until the point when $c$ starts being true, and $c$ must eventually become true.

## 6: Clarify satisfaction conditions
The formula $a U c$ is satisfied if:
- At any point in time before $c$ becomes true, $a$ is true.
- $c$ will become true at some point in the future.

It imposes a constraint on the system that $a$ must be true at least until $c$ starts being true, and it guarantees that $c$ will happen.

The final answer is: $\boxed{a is true until c becomes true}$
