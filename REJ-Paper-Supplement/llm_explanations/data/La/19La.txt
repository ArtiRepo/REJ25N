## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: F (!y & w)

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- F: "Future" operator, meaning "eventually" or "in the future".
- !y: Negation of y, meaning "y is false" or "not y".
- &: Conjunction operator, meaning "and".
- w: A proposition, meaning "w is true".

The parsing tree can be represented as:
```
     F
   /   \
 (!y &  ) 
    / \ 
   !y   w
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- !y means "y is false".
- w means "w is true".
- !y & w means "y is false and w is true".
- F (!y & w) means "eventually, y is false and w is true".

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula F (!y & w) can be translated to: "It will eventually be the case that y is false and w is true."

This means that at some point in the future, the condition where y is not true (or false) and w is true must be satisfied. It does not specify when this will happen, only that it must happen at some point.

The final answer is: $\boxed{It will eventually be the case that y is false and w is true.}$
