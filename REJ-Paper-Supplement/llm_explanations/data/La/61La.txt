## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: $a U G!a$

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To understand the formula $a U G!a$, let's break it down:
- $a$ is a proposition that is true if $a$ is occurring or is true at a given state.
- $G$ stands for "always" or "globally", meaning something is true at all future states.
- $!$ denotes negation, so $!a$ means $a$ is not true.
- $U$ stands for "until", indicating that the first condition must be true until the second condition becomes true.

The parsing tree can be seen as:
- The formula is $a U \phi$, where $\phi = G!a$
- $\phi$ is $G \psi$, where $\psi = !a$

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $\psi = !a$ means $a$ is false.
- $G \psi = G!a$ means that from the current state onwards, $a$ must always be false. In other words, $a$ is false from now on and forever.
- The $U$ operator in $a U G!a$ implies that $a$ must be true until $G!a$ becomes true. For $G!a$ to become true, $a$ must immediately become false and stay false.

## 4: Combine the meanings to understand the whole formula
The formula $a U G!a$ means that $a$ must be true until it becomes permanently false. In other words, $a$ is true now and continues to be true for some period, but eventually, $a$ becomes and remains false forever.

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
A natural language translation could be: "$a$ is true until $a$ becomes permanently false." Or more naturally: "$a$ holds until it never holds again."

## 6: Determine satisfaction conditions
The formula $a U G!a$ is satisfied if:
- There exists a point in time where $a$ starts being true.
- From that point until some future point, $a$ continues to be true.
- At some future point, $a$ becomes false and remains false forever.

## 7: Imposed constraints on the system over time
This formula imposes the constraint that the system must exhibit $a$ being true for some duration but ensures that eventually, $a$ ceases to be true and does not recur. It does not constrain how long $a$ is true before it becomes permanently false, only that it does become permanently false.

The final answer is: $\boxed{a holds until it never holds again}$
