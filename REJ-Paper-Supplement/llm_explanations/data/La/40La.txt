## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: F (o | u)

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula F (o | u), we identify its components:
- F: "Future" operator, meaning "eventually" or "in the future".
- o and u: These are propositions (or atomic formulas) representing some conditions or events in the system.
- |: The disjunction operator, meaning "or".

So, the parsing tree can be represented as:
```
     F
   /   \
  (     )
 / \   / \
o   u |  
```
Or more accurately for our purposes:
```
   F
    |
   (o | u)
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- o | u means "o or u" (at least one of them is true).
- The F operator applied to (o | u) means that "eventually, o or u will be true".

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
From the breakdown and rebuilding:
- The formula F (o | u) can be translated to: "Eventually, either o or u (or both) will be true."
- This implies that at some point in the future, at least one of the conditions o or u must be satisfied.

## 5: Explanation of satisfaction and constraints
- The formula is satisfied if, at any point in time moving forward from the current state, either o or u (or both) becomes true.
- It imposes a constraint on the system that it must reach a state where o or u is true within some finite time frame from now. There is no constraint on how long it takes for this to happen, just that it must happen.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Eventually, either o or u will be true.}$
