## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: $a U b$

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
The formula $a U b$ can be broken down into:
- $a$ and $b$ as atomic propositions
- $U$ as the "Until" operator

Parsing tree:
- $a U b$
  - $U$
    - $a$
    - $b$

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $a$ and $b$ are conditions or events that can occur at some point in time.
- The $U$ operator means "until". So, $a U b$ means that $a$ is true until $b$ becomes true.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
To refine the meaning:
- $a U b$ is satisfied if $a$ is true at the current state and remains true until $b$ becomes true. 
- It implies that $b$ must eventually become true for the formula to be satisfied; if $b$ never becomes true, the formula is not satisfied.
- A more natural way to phrase it is: "$a$ holds until $b$ holds."

## 5: Final Translation
The LTL formula $a U b$ translates to: "$a$ holds until $b$ holds." This means that for the formula to be true, $a$ must be true from the current moment and continue to be true until $b$ becomes true. Once $b$ becomes true, the condition is satisfied regardless of what happens to $a$ afterward.

The final answer is: $\boxed{a holds until b}$
