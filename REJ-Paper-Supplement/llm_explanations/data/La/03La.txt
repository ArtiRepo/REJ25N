## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: $a \& X b$.

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula $a \& X b$, we identify its components:
- $a$ is a propositional variable.
- $X b$ is a temporal formula where $X$ denotes "next" and $b$ is another propositional variable.

The parsing tree can be represented as:
```
  &
 /   \
a     X b
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $b$ is true at some state.
- $X b$ means $b$ is true at the next state.

So, $X b$ implies that $b$ must be true in the state immediately following the current state.

## 4: Combine the meanings
The entire formula is $a \& X b$. This means:
- $a$ must be true at the current state.
- $X b$ means $b$ must be true at the next state.

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Combining these conditions, the formula $a \& X b$ can be translated into natural language as: "$a$ is true and $b$ is true in the next state."

Or more naturally: "Currently, $a$ holds, and $b$ will hold in the next moment."

This implies that the system must be in a state where $a$ is satisfied now, and there is a constraint that $b$ must be satisfied in the immediate future.

The final answer is: $\boxed{a is true and b will be true in the next state}$
