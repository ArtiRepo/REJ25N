## Step 1: Write down original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: FGa

## Step 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula FGa, we first identify its components:
- F (Future operator, meaning "eventually")
- G (Globally operator, meaning "always")
- a (a proposition, which can be thought of as an atomic statement)

The parsing tree can be represented as:
```
  F
 / 
G a
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- "a" is a proposition that can be true or false at any given time.
- "G a" means that "a" is true globally, i.e., always. This implies that at every point in time, "a" must be true.
- "F (G a)" means that "eventually, 'a' will be true globally" or more naturally, "'a' will be true from some point onward forever".

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula FGa can be translated to: "It will eventually be the case that 'a' is always true."

This means that the system will reach a point in time after which "a" is continuously true. Before that point, "a" can be true or false, but from that point onward, "a" must be true.

## 5: Clarify satisfaction and constraints
- The formula is satisfied if there exists a point in time t such that for all times t' ≥ t, "a" is true.
- It imposes a constraint on the system that it must reach a state where "a" holds and remains true for all future times.

The final answer is: $\boxed{It will eventually be the case that 'a' is always true.}$
