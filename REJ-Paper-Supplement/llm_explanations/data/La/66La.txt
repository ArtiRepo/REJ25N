## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: $F(a \land b)$ is not what we have; instead, we have $Fa \land Fb$.

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To parse $Fa \land Fb$, we break it down into its components:
- $Fa$
- $Fb$
The operator $\land$ indicates conjunction, meaning "and". The operator $F$ indicates "eventually" or "in the future".

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $Fa$ means "eventually $a$" or "$a$ will be true at some point in the future".
- $Fb$ means "eventually $b$" or "$b$ will be true at some point in the future".
The combination $Fa \land Fb$ means that both $Fa$ and $Fb$ must be true.

## 4: Interpret the combined meaning
For $Fa \land Fb$ to be true, it is necessary that:
- There exists some point in the future where $a$ is true.
- There exists some point in the future where $b$ is true.
However, it does not require that both $a$ and $b$ become true at the same time; it only requires that both become true at some point in the future.

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula $Fa \land Fb$ can be translated to natural language as: "$a$ will be true at some point in the future and $b$ will be true at some point in the future."
Or more idiomatically: "It will eventually be the case that $a$ is true, and it will also eventually be the case that $b$ is true."

## 6: Clarify constraints over time
This formula imposes the constraint that the system must reach a state where $a$ is true and, separately, a state where $b$ is true, but it does not specify that these states must be reached simultaneously or in any particular order.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Fa \land Fb}$
