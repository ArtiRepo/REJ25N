## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: $t \Rightarrow w$.

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula $t \Rightarrow w$, we identify its components:
- $t$ is an atomic proposition.
- $w$ is an atomic proposition.
- $\Rightarrow$ is the implication operator.
- The parsing tree can be represented as:
  ```
     ⇒
   /   \
  t     w
  ```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $t$ and $w$ are statements that can be true or false at any given time.
- The implication $\Rightarrow$ means that if the antecedent (the part on the left, $t$) is true, then the consequent (the part on the right, $w$) must also be true for the entire implication to be true.

## 4: Interpret the implication in LTL context
In LTL, $t \Rightarrow w$ means that whenever $t$ is true, $w$ must also be true. However, if $t$ is false, $w$ can be either true or false, and the implication still holds. This is because an implication is only false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The natural language translation of $t \Rightarrow w$ can be: "Whenever $t$ is true, $w$ must be true." Or more simply, "If $t$, then $w$".

## 6: Consider the temporal aspect
Since this is an LTL formula, we must consider its truth value over time. The formula $t \Rightarrow w$ implies that at any point in time, if $t$ is true, then $w$ must be true at that same point in time. It does not impose any direct constraint on future or past states based on the implication alone but does so in the context of when $t$ and $w$ are evaluated.

## 7: Finalize the natural language translation with temporal context
The finalized translation with a focus on temporal logic is: "At any time, if $t$ is true, then $w$ is true." This captures the essence that the implication holds at every point in time, reflecting the LTL's focus on sequences of states over time.

The final answer is: $\boxed{If t then w}$
