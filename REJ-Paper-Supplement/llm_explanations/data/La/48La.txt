## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: $b \land X (a U c)$.

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- The formula is a conjunction ($\land$) of two parts: $b$ and $X (a U c)$.
- $X (a U c)$ is a temporal operator ("next") applied to the until ($U$) operator between $a$ and $c$.
So, the parsing tree can be represented as:
- Root: $\land$
  - Left child: $b$
  - Right child: $X (a U c)$
    - $X$ (next)
      - $U$ (until)
        - Left child: $a$
        - Right child: $c$

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $a U c$ means that $a$ is true until $c$ becomes true. This implies that $c$ must eventually become true, and $a$ must be true from the current moment until then (but not necessarily after $c$ becomes true).
- $X (a U c)$ means that in the next state, $a U c$ holds. This implies that one step from now, $a$ will be true until $c$ becomes true.
- $b \land X (a U c)$ means that $b$ is true now, and in the next state, $a$ will be true until $c$ becomes true.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula $b \land X (a U c)$ can be translated into natural language as: "$b$ is true now, and from the next moment on, $a$ will be true until $c$ becomes true."
This implies two main constraints:
1. $b$ must be true in the current state.
2. Starting from the next state, $a$ must be true in every state until $c$ becomes true.

## 5: Final Translation and Explanation
The LTL formula $b \land X (a U c)$ is satisfied when:
- $b$ is true in the current state.
- In the next state, $a$ starts being true and continues to be true in subsequent states until $c$ becomes true.

This imposes constraints on the system:
- The system must be in a state where $b$ is true right now.
- One step from now, the system must enter a phase where $a$ is true, and this phase continues until the system reaches a state where $c$ is true.

The final answer is: $\boxed{b is true now, and from the next moment on, a will be true until c becomes true.}$
