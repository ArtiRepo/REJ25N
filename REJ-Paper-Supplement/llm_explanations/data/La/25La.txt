## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: `!X t`

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- `!` denotes negation (NOT)
- `X` denotes the next state (the state at the next time step)
- `t` is a proposition (a statement that can be true or false)

So, the parsing tree can be seen as:
```
  !
 / 
! 
  X t
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- `X t` means "at the next state, `t` is true" or "in the next time step, `t` holds".
- Applying the negation `!` to `X t`, we get `!X t`, which means "it is not the case that `t` is true at the next state" or "in the next time step, `t` does not hold".

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Refining the meaning:
- `!X t` can be translated to "it will not be the case that `t` at the next time step" or more naturally as "t will be false in the next state".

However, to make it sound more fluent and clear in natural language, we can phrase it as: "`t` will not be true at the next time step" or simply "`t` will be false next".

The final answer is: $\boxed{t will be false next}$
