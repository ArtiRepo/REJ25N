## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula given is: $XXFa$.

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To understand the formula $XXFa$, let's break it down:
- $F$ is a temporal operator that means "eventually" or "in the future".
- $a$ is a proposition that can be true or false.
- $X$ is a temporal operator that means "next" or "in the next state".

So, the parsing tree from top to bottom is:
- $XXFa$
  - $X$ 
    - $X$ 
      - $F$ 
        - $a$

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $a$ is a proposition that needs to be true at some point.
- $F$ (eventually) $a$ means that $a$ will be true at some point in the future, but not necessarily immediately.
- $X$ (next) $Fa$ means that in the next state, $Fa$ will be true, implying that after the current state, $a$ will eventually be true.
- $XXFa$ means that two steps from now, $Fa$ will be true. In other words, $XFa$ needs to be true in the next state. This implies that in the state after next, $a$ will eventually be true.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Given $XXFa$, we can say: "Two steps from now, $a$ will eventually be true." This means that if we are currently in state $s$, then in state $s+2$, there exists a future state (which could be $s+2$ itself or later) where $a$ is true.

## 5: Final Translation
The LTL formula $XXFa$ translates to: "$a$ will eventually be true two steps from now." Or more naturally, "In two steps, $a$ will become true at some point in the future."

The final answer is: $\boxed{Two steps from now, a will eventually be true.}$
