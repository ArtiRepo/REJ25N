## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: G(a->b)

## Step 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula G(a->b), we identify its components:
- The outermost operator is G (always)
- The inner formula is a->b (a implies b)

Further breaking down a->b:
- a is a proposition
- b is a proposition
- -> is the implication operator

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- a and b are propositions that can be true or false at any given time.
- a->b means "if a then b". This implication is false only when a is true and b is false. Otherwise, it is true.

## 4: Interpret the G operator
The G operator means "always" or "globally". So, G(a->b) means that "always, if a then b".

## 5: Combine the meanings
Combining the meanings:
- G(a->b) is satisfied if, at all times, whenever a is true, b is also true. 
- It does not impose any constraint on the system when a is false because the implication a->b is automatically true whenever a is false.

## 6: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
A clear natural language translation of G(a->b) is: "At all times, if a is true, then b must be true" or equivalently, "Whenever a is true, b must be true" or simply "a implies b, always".

## 7: Explain satisfaction and constraints
- The formula G(a->b) is satisfied if, in every state of the system (at every point in time), the implication a->b holds.
- It imposes a constraint on the system that whenever proposition a is true, proposition b must also be true, but it does not restrict the truth of a and b when a is false.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Always, if a then b}$
