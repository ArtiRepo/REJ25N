## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: `(!a)U(a and XG!a)`

## Step 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To parse the given LTL formula, we break it down into its components:
- `!a` (not a)
- `a and XG!a` (a and X globally not a)
- The entire formula: `(!a)U(a and XG!a)` which can be read as "until".

## 3: Understand the components
- `!a` means "a is false".
- `XG!a` means "globally from the next state, a is false". The `X` operator denotes "next" and `G` denotes "globally".
- `a and XG!a` means "a is true and globally from the next state, a is false".
- `U` denotes "until".

## 4: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- `G!a` means that from a certain point in time, `!a` holds forever.
- `XG!a` means that from the next state onwards, `!a` holds forever.
- `a and XG!a` means that `a` is true now, and from the next state onwards, `a` is false forever.
- `!a` means that `a` is false.
- `(!a)U(a and XG!a)` means that `!a` holds until `a and XG!a` becomes true.

## 5: Analyze the until operator (`U`)
The until operator `U` implies that:
- The left-hand side (`!a`) must hold at least until the right-hand side (`a and XG!a`) becomes true.
- If the right-hand side never becomes true, the formula is false.

## 6: Combine the meanings
The formula `(!a)U(a and XG!a)` can be understood as: "`a` is false until `a` becomes true and stays false forever after".

## 7: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
A more natural way to phrase this is: "It is not the case that `a` until `a` becomes true and from then on `a` remains false forever."

## 8: Final Translation
A clearer translation could be: "The system will experience `a` being false until it reaches a point where `a` is true and then `a` remains false forever."

However, to make it even simpler and accurate:
- The formula essentially describes a situation where `a` starts as false, becomes true at some point, and then remains false forever after that point.

The final answer is: $\boxed{"a is false until a becomes true and then remains false forever."}$
