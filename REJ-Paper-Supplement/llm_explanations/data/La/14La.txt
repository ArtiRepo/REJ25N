## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: (d U c) | (a U !c)

## Step 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its main components:
- The formula is a disjunction (OR, denoted by |) of two subformulas: (d U c) and (a U !c).
- (d U c) means "d until c".
- (a U !c) means "a until not c".

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- "d U c" is satisfied if d is true until c becomes true. This means c must eventually become true, and until then, d must be true. If c never becomes true, the formula (d U c) is not satisfied.
- "a U !c" is satisfied if a is true until !c (not c) becomes true. This means !c must eventually become true (c must become false), and until then, a must be true.

## 4: Analyze the disjunction
The disjunction "|" between (d U c) and (a U !c) means that at least one of these two conditions must be satisfied for the entire formula to be true.

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Combining the understanding:
- The formula (d U c) | (a U !c) can be translated to: "Either d remains true until c becomes true, or a remains true until c becomes false."

## 6: Further clarification
For clarity and precision in natural language:
- The first part, "d remains true until c becomes true," implies that c must become true at some point for this part to be satisfied. If c never becomes true, this condition fails.
- The second part, "a remains true until c becomes false," implies that c must become false at some point for this part to be satisfied. If c never becomes false (always true), this condition fails.

## 7: Final natural language translation
The LTL formula (d U c) | (a U !c) translates to: "The system must satisfy one of the following conditions: 
- Continue to have d true until c becomes true, 
- Continue to have a true until c becomes false."

The final answer is: $\boxed{(d U c) | (a U !c)}$
