## Step 1: Write down original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula given is XXXa. In LTL, "X" denotes "next" (or "after one time step"), and "a" is a proposition that can be either true or false at any given time.

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
The formula XXXa can be broken down into a parsing tree as follows:
- The top-level operator is X.
- The argument of this X operator is another X operator applied to a.
So, the parsing tree can be represented as:
```
     X
    / 
   X
  /
 X
/
a
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- "a" simply means that proposition "a" is true.
- "Xa" means that "a" is true at the next time step.
- "XXa" means that "a" is true two time steps from now.
- "XXXa" means that "a" is true three time steps from now.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Given the meaning of XXXa, we can translate it into natural language as: "It will be the case that 'a' is true three time steps from now."

## 5: Explanation for satisfaction and constraints
- The formula XXXa is satisfied if, at any given point in time, three time steps later, proposition "a" is true.
- It imposes a constraint on the system that "a" must become true exactly three time steps after the current time step, without specifying what happens at other time steps.

The final answer is: $\boxed{It will be true that 'a' is true three time steps from now.}$
