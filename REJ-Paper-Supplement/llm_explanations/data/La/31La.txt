## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: $d \& X (c U a)$

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- $d$ is a proposition.
- $X$ is the next-time operator, which means "next time" or "in the next state".
- $c U a$ is a until operator, which means "c until a".

The parsing tree can be represented as:
- Root: $d \& X (c U a)$
  - Left child: $d$
  - Right child: $X (c U a)$
    - Child: $c U a$
      - Left child: $c$
      - Right child: $a$

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $c U a$ means that $c$ is true until $a$ becomes true. This implies that $c$ must be true in the current state and all subsequent states until $a$ becomes true. If $a$ never becomes true, $c$ must remain true indefinitely.

## 4: Interpret the $X$ operator
- $X (c U a)$ means that in the next state, the condition $c U a$ must hold. This implies that from the current state to the next state, and onwards, $c$ must be true until $a$ becomes true.

## 5: Combine with $d$
- The entire formula $d \& X (c U a)$ requires that $d$ is true in the current state, and in the next state, $c U a$ must start being true. This means $d$ must be true now, and from the next state onwards, $c$ must be true until $a$ becomes true.

## 6: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula $d \& X (c U a)$ can be translated to natural language as: "$d$ is true now, and from the next moment on, $c$ will be true until $a$ becomes true."

This implies two main constraints:
1. $d$ must be true in the current state.
2. Starting from the next state, $c$ must be true in every state until $a$ becomes true.

## 7: Final Translation
The LTL formula $d \& X (c U a)$ translates to: "Currently, $d$ is true, and from the next state onwards, $c$ will hold until $a$ is satisfied."

The final answer is: $\boxed{d is true now, and from the next moment on, c will be true until a becomes true.}$
