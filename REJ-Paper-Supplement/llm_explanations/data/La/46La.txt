## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: F d | G !n

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- F d (Eventually d)
- G !n (Always not n)
The parsing tree can be represented as:
```
      |
     / \
    F d  |  G !n
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- F d means "d will be true at some point in the future."
- G !n means "n will never be true; it is always false."

## 4: Combine the meanings
The "|" operator represents "or." So, F d | G !n means:
- Either "d will be true at some point in the future" or "n will never be true."

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Refining the phrasing:
- The formula F d | G !n can be translated to: "Either d will become true at some point, or n will remain false forever."

## 6: Explain satisfaction conditions
- This formula is satisfied if either d becomes true at any point in the future (no matter what happens with n), or if n remains false at all times (regardless of when or if d becomes true).

## 7: Explain constraints on the system over time
- The system satisfies the formula if it meets either of the conditions: 
  1. There exists a future point in time where d is true.
  2. n is never true at any point in time.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Either d will become true at some point, or n will remain false forever.}$
