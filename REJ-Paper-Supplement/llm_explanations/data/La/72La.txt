## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: G !a

## Step 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
The parsing tree for the given LTL formula breaks down as follows:
- The outermost operator is G (always)
- The operand of G is !a (not a)
- ! is the negation operator
- a is a proposition

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- a represents a proposition that can be true or false at any given time.
- !a means "not a", which is true if a is false and false if a is true.
- G !a means "always (!a)", which implies that !a must be true at all time steps.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Given that !a is true whenever a is false, G !a can be translated to: "It is always the case that a is false" or more naturally as "a is never true".

## 5: Explain satisfaction and constraints
- The formula G !a is satisfied if and only if a remains false at all time steps.
- It imposes a constraint on the system that proposition a must never become true.

The final translation of G !a into natural language is: "a is always false" or "a never holds true".
