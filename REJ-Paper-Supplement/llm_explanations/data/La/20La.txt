## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: G t | F w

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- G: Always (globally)
- t: A proposition (condition) that is true at some state
- |: Or (logical disjunction)
- F: Eventually (in the future)
- w: Another proposition (condition) that is true at some state

The parsing tree can be seen as:
```
     |
    / \
   G t  F w
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- F w means "w will be true at some point in the future."
- G t means "t is true at all times (globally)."

The | operator combines these with a logical OR, so:
- G t | F w means "(t is true at all times) or (w will be true at some point in the future)."

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Refining the meaning:
- The formula G t | F w is satisfied if either t is true at every moment in time, or if there exists a moment in the future when w becomes true.
- It imposes a constraint on the system such that either t must hold continuously, or w must become true at some point.

A clear natural language translation could be: "Either t is always true, or w will become true at some point in the future."

## 5: Conclusion on satisfaction and constraints
The formula is satisfied under two conditions:
1. If t is true at all times.
2. If there exists a future point in time where w is true.

It imposes a constraint that the system must satisfy at least one of these conditions over time.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Either t is always true, or w will become true at some point in the future.}$
