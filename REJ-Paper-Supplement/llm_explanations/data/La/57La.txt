## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: $F(a) \land G(a \rightarrow XG(\neg a))$.

## Step 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- $F(a)$
- $G(a \rightarrow XG(\neg a))$

Further breaking down $G(a \rightarrow XG(\neg a))$:
- $a \rightarrow XG(\neg a)$
- $XG(\neg a)$

So, the tree can be seen as:
- $F(a) \land G(...)$
  - $F(a)$
  - $G(...)$
    - $a \rightarrow ...$
      - $a$
      - $XG(\neg a)$
        - $X...$
          - $G(\neg a)$

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $G(\neg a)$ means "always, $a$ is false". In other words, "$a$ is never true again".
- $XG(\neg a)$ means "next, always $a$ is false". So, "$a$ will be false from the next state onwards".
- $a \rightarrow XG(\neg a)$ means "if $a$ is true, then next, always $a$ is false". So, "if $a$ is true, then $a$ will be false from the next state onwards".
- $G(a \rightarrow XG(\neg a))$ means "always, if $a$ is true, then next, always $a$ is false". This implies that once $a$ becomes true, it will be false from the next state onwards and stay false.

## 4: Understand $F(a)$
- $F(a)$ means "there exists a future state where $a$ is true". In simpler terms, "$a$ will be true at some point in the future".

## 5: Combine the meanings
Combining $F(a) \land G(a \rightarrow XG(\neg a))$:
- The system will eventually have $a$ true at some point ($F(a)$).
- From that point onwards, and in general, if $a$ is true, then it must become false immediately after and stay false ($G(a \rightarrow XG(\neg a))$).

## 6: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula implies that:
- The system will experience a state where $a$ is true at some point in the future.
- Once $a$ becomes true, it must immediately become false and remain false thereafter.

Thus, a natural language translation could be: "The system will eventually have $a$ true, and when it does, $a$ will immediately become false and remain false forever."

The final answer is: $\boxed{"The system will eventually have a true, and when it does, a will immediately become false and remain false forever."}$
