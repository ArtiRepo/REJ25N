## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: $X b \Rightarrow \neg X d$

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- $X b$ means "b will be true in the next state"
- $\neg X d$ means "it is not the case that d will be true in the next state" or equivalently "d will be false in the next state"
- $\Rightarrow$ denotes implication

The parsing tree can be seen as:
```
      ⇒
   /      \
  X b     ¬ X d
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $X b$ is true if in the next state, $b$ is true.
- $\neg X d$ is true if in the next state, $d$ is false.

The implication $X b \Rightarrow \neg X d$ is true whenever:
- $X b$ is false (meaning $b$ is not true in the next state), or
- $\neg X d$ is true (meaning $d$ is false in the next state).

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula $X b \Rightarrow \neg X d$ can be translated to natural language as: "If $b$ will be true in the next state, then $d$ will be false in the next state."

This implies that whenever $b$ becomes true in the next state, $d$ must be false in that next state. If $b$ does not become true in the next state, there is no constraint on $d$ from this formula alone.

## 5: Clarify satisfaction and constraints
The formula is satisfied if:
- $b$ is not true in the next state (regardless of $d$'s value), or
- If $b$ is true in the next state, then $d$ must be false in that next state.

It imposes a constraint on the system that if $b$ becomes true, $d$ cannot be true in the immediate next state.

The final answer is: $\boxed{If $b$ will be true in the next state, then $d$ will be false in the next state.}$
