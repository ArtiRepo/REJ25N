## Step 1: Write down original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: $a U !a$

## Step 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
The formula $a U !a$ can be broken down into:
- $a$ (a atomic proposition)
- $!a$ (negation of $a$)
- $U$ (until operator)

The parsing tree can be represented as:
```
   U
 /   \
a     !a
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $a$ means that $a$ is true.
- $!a$ means that $a$ is false.

The until operator $U$ implies that the first argument must be true until the second argument becomes true. Therefore, $a U !a$ means that $a$ must be true until $a$ becomes false.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
To refine the natural language phrasing:
- $a U !a$ can be translated to: "$a$ is true until $a$ becomes false."
- More naturally, it can be phrased as: "$a$ holds until it becomes false."

This implies that for the formula $a U !a$ to be satisfied, $a$ must initially be true and remain true until at some point it becomes false. There are no constraints on what happens after $a$ becomes false; the formula is satisfied as long as $a$ was true until it became false.

The final answer is: $\boxed{a holds until it becomes false}$
