## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: X !(t | w)

## Step 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- X (next time)
- ! (negation)
- t (proposition t)
- w (proposition w)
- | (disjunction, meaning "or")

The parsing tree can be represented as follows:
```
  X
 / 
!(  )
   / \
  t   w
   \   /
    |
```

However, a more accurate representation reflecting the structure would consider the disjunction first:
```
  X
 /
! (t | w)
```

Breaking it down:
1. t and w are propositions.
2. t | w means "t or w".
3. !(t | w) means "not (t or w)".
4. X !(t | w) means "next time, not (t or w)".

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- t | w is true if either t is true or w is true (or both).
- !(t | w) is true if neither t nor w is true. This means both t and w must be false for !(t | w) to be true.
- X !(t | w) means that at the next time step, both t and w must be false.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula X !(t | w) can be translated into natural language as: "At the next time step, neither t nor w is true."

Or, more idiomatically: "In the next state, both t and w must be false."

This implies a constraint on the system that at the immediate next time step, both conditions t and w should not be occurring.

## 5: Final Translation and Explanation
The LTL formula X !(t | w) imposes a constraint that in the next state of the system, neither of the propositions t or w should be true. This means if we are considering the state of the system over time, at any given point, if we move to the next point in time, we must observe that both t and w are false. If this condition is met at every step where it's required, the formula is satisfied. If there's any point in time where moving to the next step doesn't satisfy this (i.e., either t or w or both are true), the formula is not satisfied.

The final answer is: $\boxed{In the next state, both t and w must be false.}$
