## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: G a

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
The formula "G a" can be broken down into:
- G (a temporal operator meaning "always" or "globally")
- a (a propositional variable)

The parsing tree is straightforward since there's only one operator and one variable:
```
    G
   / 
  a
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- "a" represents a condition or proposition that can be true or false at any given time.
- The operator "G" applied to "a" means that "a" must be true at all times.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Given the meaning of "G" as "always" or "globally", the formula G a translates to: "a is always true" or "a holds globally". This means that for the formula G a to be satisfied, the condition "a" must be true at every point in time.

## 5: Explain satisfaction and constraints
- The formula G a is satisfied if and only if "a" is true at all time steps, from the initial state onwards.
- It imposes a constraint on the system that "a" must hold true at all times; if at any point "a" becomes false, the formula G a is violated.

The final answer is: $\boxed{a is always true}$
