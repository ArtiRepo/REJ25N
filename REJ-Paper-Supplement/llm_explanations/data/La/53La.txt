## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: $Fa \rightarrow Gb$

## Step 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- $Fa$ means "a is true from now on" or "a is always true".
- $Gb$ means "b is true from some point on" or "b is eventually true".
- $\rightarrow$ denotes implication.

The parsing tree can be represented as:
```
  ->
 /   \
Fa     Gb
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $Fa$ implies that $a$ must be true at all times from the current point onwards.
- $Gb$ implies that $b$ must be true at some point from the current point onwards.

The implication $Fa \rightarrow Gb$ means that if $Fa$ is true, then $Gb$ must also be true.

## 4: Interpret the implication
The implication $P \rightarrow Q$ is equivalent to $\neg P \vee Q$. Applying this to our formula:
- $\neg Fa \vee Gb$

This can be read as: "Either $a$ is not always true from now on, or $b$ is eventually true."

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
- $\neg Fa$ means that it is not the case that $a$ is always true from now on, which implies that $a$ can be false at some point in the future.
- So, $\neg Fa \vee Gb$ can be phrased as: "Either $a$ becomes false at some point, or $b$ becomes true at some point."

## 6: Final translation
The LTL formula $Fa \rightarrow Gb$ can be translated to natural language as: "If $a$ is always true from now on, then $b$ will eventually be true." Or more simply: "If $a$ holds forever, then $b$ will hold eventually."

The final answer is: $\boxed{If a is always true from now on, then b will eventually be true.}$
