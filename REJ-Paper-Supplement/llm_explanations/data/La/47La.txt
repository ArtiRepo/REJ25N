## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: $a U (c \& d)$.

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- The formula is $a U (c \& d)$.
- $a$ is a proposition.
- $U$ is the "until" operator, which means that $a$ must hold until the condition $(c \& d)$ is satisfied.
- $c \& d$ is a conjunction of propositions $c$ and $d$, meaning both $c$ and $d$ must be true.

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $c \& d$ means both $c$ and $d$ must be true at the same time.
- The $U$ operator implies that $a$ must be true from now on until the point when $c \& d$ becomes true.
- The formula $a U (c \& d)$ is satisfied if $a$ is true at every point in time until $c \& d$ becomes true. Once $c \& d$ is true, the formula is satisfied regardless of $a$'s truth value from that point onwards.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The natural language translation of $a U (c \& d)$ can be refined as follows:
- "It will be the case that $a$ until $c$ and $d$ are both true."
- More intuitively, "$a$ must hold at least until the moment when both $c$ and $d$ become true."

## 5: Clarify satisfaction conditions and constraints
- The formula is satisfied if $a$ is true at every moment until the moment when both $c$ and $d$ are true. 
- After $c \& d$ becomes true, the truth value of $a$ no longer affects the satisfaction of the formula.
- The formula imposes a constraint that $a$ must be true until $c \& d$ is true. If $c \& d$ never becomes true, $a$ must remain true indefinitely for the formula to be satisfied.

The final answer is: $\boxed{a must hold until both c and d are true}$
