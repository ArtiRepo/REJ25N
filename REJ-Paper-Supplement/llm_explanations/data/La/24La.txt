## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: $t \Rightarrow (x \land y)$.

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- $t$ is a proposition.
- $x$ and $y$ are propositions.
- $\Rightarrow$ denotes implication.
- $\land$ denotes conjunction.

The parsing tree can be represented as:
```
     ⇒
   /   \
  t     ∧
       / \
      x   y
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $x \land y$ means that both $x$ and $y$ must be true.
- The implication $t \Rightarrow (x \land y)$ means that if $t$ is true, then $x \land y$ must be true.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The implication $t \Rightarrow (x \land y)$ can be translated to natural language as: "If $t$ then $x$ and $y$".

However, to be more precise in the context of LTL (Linear Temporal Logic), which deals with the behavior of systems over time:
- $t \Rightarrow (x \land y)$ implies that whenever $t$ is true at any point in time, both $x$ and $y$ must also be true at that same point in time.

## 5: Clarify the constraints on the system over time
This formula imposes a constraint that if proposition $t$ holds at any time step, then both propositions $x$ and $y$ must hold at that same time step. It does not restrict $t$, $x$, or $y$ from being true or false at other time steps, as long as this condition is met when $t$ is true.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Whenever $t$ is true, both $x$ and $y$ must be true.}$
