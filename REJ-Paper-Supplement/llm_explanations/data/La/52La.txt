## Step 1: Write down original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: `XXFXa`

## Step 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- `X` denotes "next" or "in the next state"
- `F` denotes "eventually" or "some time in the future"
- `a` is a proposition that can be true or false

The parsing tree breaks down as follows:
- `XXFXa` is composed of `X` and `XFXa`
- `XFXa` is composed of `X` and `FXa`
- `FXa` is composed of `F` and `Xa`
- `Xa` is composed of `X` and `a`

So, the tree can be seen as:
```
  XXFXa
 /    \
X     XFXa
     /    \
    X     FXa
       /    \
      F     Xa
     /       \
    X       a
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- `a` is true in some state.
- `Xa` means `a` is true in the next state.
- `FXa` means that eventually, `a` will be true in the next state. This implies that there exists some future state where `a` is true and it's preceded by another state (because of `X` inside `F`).
- `XFXa` means that in the next state, it will be the case that `FXa`. This implies that from the next state onwards, there exists a point in the future where `a` will be true, and that point is preceded by another state.
- `XXFXa` means that in the next state (of the current state), it will be the case that `XFXa`. This implies two steps into the future, there will be a point where `FXa` holds, meaning there will be a state where `a` is preceded by another state.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Given the breakdown, `XXFXa` can be translated to: "Two steps from now, there will be a point in the future where `a` becomes true, preceded by at least one other state."

However, a more natural way to phrase it while preserving the meaning could be: "It will be the case that two steps from now, `a` will eventually become true after at least one state."

A clearer and more idiomatic translation might be: "In two steps, `a` will become true at some point after at least one step."

This captures the essence that two steps into the future, there's a point where `a` is true, and it's not immediately after the two steps but after at least one more step.

The final answer is: $\boxed{In two steps, a will become true at some point after at least one step.}$
