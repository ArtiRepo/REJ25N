## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: Xa U Xb

## Step 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula Xa U Xb, we identify the operators and operands:
- Xa and Xb are the operands, where X is the next operator.
- U is the operator, which stands for "until".

The parsing tree can be represented as:
```
    U
   / \
  X a  X b
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- Xa means "a is true in the next state".
- Xb means "b is true in the next state".
- The U operator (until) means that the first operand must be true until the second operand becomes true.

## 4: Combine the meanings
Combining these, Xa U Xb means that "a is true in the next state until b is true in the next state".

However, to accurately translate this into natural language and understand its implications, we must consider the properties of LTL, especially the next operator X and the until operator U.

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Given the until operator U, the formula Xa U Xb can be satisfied if:
- There exists a point in time (or a state in the system's execution) where a is true in the next state and remains true in all subsequent states until b is true in the next state.

A more natural way to phrase this, considering the next operator X, is:
"The system will be in a state where a is true immediately after the current state, and it will remain that way until immediately after the current state, b becomes true."

However, this direct translation might be confusing due to the next operator's influence on both a and b. A clearer interpretation considers that Xa U Xb essentially demands that from the next state onwards, a must hold until b holds in the subsequent state.

## 6: Final Translation
A clearer translation could be: "Starting from the next state, a will be true in every state until, in the state after that, b becomes true."

But to make it even simpler and accurate with LTL semantics:
"The system must have 'a' true in the next state and keep 'a' true in subsequent states until 'b' is true in the state after the next one."

The final answer is: $\boxed{Xa U Xb}$
