## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: $a U (b \& c)$

## Step 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- The formula is $a U (b \& c)$.
- $a$ is an atomic proposition.
- $b \& c$ is a conjunction of atomic propositions $b$ and $c$.
- $U$ denotes "until".

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $b \& c$ means both $b$ and $c$ must be true.
- The $U$ operator means "until". So, $a U (b \& c)$ means that $a$ must be true until $b \& c$ becomes true.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
To refine the meaning:
- The formula $a U (b \& c)$ is satisfied if $a$ is true from the start and remains true until the point when both $b$ and $c$ become true. After both $b$ and $c$ are true, the formula does not impose any further requirements on $a$.
- A more natural way to phrase this is: "$a$ must hold until $b$ and $c$ are both true."

## 5: Detailed Explanation
For the LTL formula $a U (b \& c)$ to be satisfied:
- Initially, $a$ must be true.
- $a$ must continue to be true at every step until the condition $b \& c$ is met.
- Once $b \& c$ becomes true (meaning both $b$ and $c$ are true), the requirement for $a$ to be true is lifted, and the formula is satisfied regardless of the truth values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ thereafter.

## 6: Final Natural Language Translation
The LTL formula $a U (b \& c)$ translates to: "$a$ must be true until both $b$ and $c$ are true."

The final answer is: $\boxed{a must be true until both b and c are true}$
