## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: F(a and b).

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula F(a and b), we first identify its components:
- F: This is a temporal operator meaning "eventually" or "in the future."
- a and b: These are atomic propositions that can be true or false.

The parsing tree can be represented as:
```
      F
     / \
    ∧   ∅ (or implicitly understood as part of the future)
   / \
  a   b
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- a and b are conditions that must both be true.
- The ∧ (and) operator between a and b means that both a and b need to be satisfied simultaneously.
- The F operator in front of (a and b) means that at some point in the future, (a and b) must both be true.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Combining the information:
- The formula F(a and b) means that at some point in the future, both a and b will be true.
- It does not specify when exactly both a and b will be true, just that there will be a moment when both conditions are met.
- This imposes a constraint on the system that it must reach a state where both a and b are true at least once.

## 5: Final Translation
The LTL formula F(a and b) translates to: "Eventually, both a and b will be true."

This translation captures the essence of the LTL formula, conveying that there is a future point in time where both conditions a and b are satisfied simultaneously.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Eventually, both a and b will be true.}$
