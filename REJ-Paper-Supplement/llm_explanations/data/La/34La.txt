## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: G (!f | !i)

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- G: Globally (always)
- !f: Not f
- !i: Not i
- |: Or

The parsing tree can be seen as:
```
G
|
|-- (!f | !i)
    |
    |-- !
    |   |
    |-- f
    |
    |-- !
        |
        |-- i
```
Or more accurately for our purposes:
```
G
|
|-- Or
    |
    |-- Not f
    |-- Not i
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- Not f means "f is false".
- Not i means "i is false".
- The "or" (|) operator between them means that at least one of them must be true for the whole expression (!f | !i) to be true. This translates to "either f is false or i is false (or both)".
- The G operator means that the condition must hold globally, i.e., at all times.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Putting it all together, G (!f | !i) can be translated to: "It is always the case that either f is false or i is false (or both)".

This implies that the system must be in a state where at least one of the conditions f or i is not satisfied at all times. In other words, it imposes a constraint on the system that neither f nor i can be true at the same time, globally.

## 5: Final Translation
The final translation in natural language, with a focus on clarity and the constraints it imposes over time, is: "At all times, f and i cannot both be true".

The final answer is: $\boxed{At all times, f and i cannot both be true}$
