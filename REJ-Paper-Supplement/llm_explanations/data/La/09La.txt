## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: `(c & b) U a`

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- The formula is a Until (`U`) operator applied to two subformulas: `(c & b)` and `a`.
- `(c & b)` is a conjunction (`&`) of `c` and `b`.

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- `c` and `b` are atomic propositions that must both be true for `(c & b)` to be true.
- The Until (`U`) operator `(c & b) U a` means that `a` must become true at some point in the future, and until then, `(c & b)` must be true.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
- `(c & b)` being true means both `c` and `b` are true.
- The Until operator `U` indicates a condition that must hold until another condition is met.
- Therefore, `(c & b) U a` can be translated to: "Both `c` and `b` must be true until `a` becomes true."

## 5: Clarify satisfaction conditions
- The formula is satisfied if there exists a point in time where `a` becomes true, and at all previous points in time, both `c` and `b` were true.
- It imposes a constraint on the system that both `c` and `b` must be true at least until the moment `a` becomes true.

## 6: Final Translation
The LTL formula `(c & b) U a` translates to: "The system must have both conditions `c` and `b` true until condition `a` is satisfied."

The final answer is: $\boxed{(c \& b) U a}$
