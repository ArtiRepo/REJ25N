## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: G(a -> X!b)

## Step 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- The outermost operator is G (always)
- The inner expression is a -> X!b
- The components of the inner expression are:
  - a
  - X!b (which is !Xb, meaning "not Xb" or "not (next b)")

## 3: Further break down X!b
- X represents "next"
- ! represents "not"
- b is a proposition

So, the breakdown is:
```
      G
     / \
    /   \
a ->    X!b
 / \   /  \
a   -> X   !b
       \   / 
        \ / 
         b
```

## 4: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- b is a proposition that can be true or false at any given time.
- !b means "not b", so it's true if b is false and vice versa.
- X!b means "next (!b)", which is true if !b is true at the next time step. In simpler terms, X!b is true if b is false at the next time step.
- a -> X!b means "if a then X!b". This implication is true unless a is true and X!b is false. So, it's false only when a is true and b is true at the next time step.
- G(a -> X!b) means "always (if a then X!b)". For this to be true, the implication a -> X!b must hold at all time steps.

## 5: Determine when the formula is satisfied and constraints it imposes
The formula G(a -> X!b) is satisfied if, at every time step, the following condition holds:
- If a is true, then b must be false at the next time step.

It imposes a constraint on the system that whenever a becomes true, b must become false at the very next time step. If a is false, there is no restriction on b imposed by this formula at that time step.

## 6: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
A natural language translation of G(a -> X!b) could be:
"Always, if a is true, then b will be false at the next time step."

Or, in a more fluid phrasing:
"Whenever a occurs, b must be false immediately after."

This captures the essence of the constraint that the system must adhere to, in terms of the relationship between the truth values of a and b over time.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Whenever a occurs, b must be false immediately after.}$
