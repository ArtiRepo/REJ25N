## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: X (t | w)

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- X: Next (a temporal operator that refers to the next state)
- t and w: Propositional variables (atomic propositions)
- |: Or (a logical operator)

The parsing tree can be represented as:
```
     X
    / \
   (   )
  / \ / \
 t   |   w
```

Or more accurately for LTL syntax:
```
  X
   |
  (t | w)
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- t | w means "t or w" - at least one of t or w must be true.

## 4: Apply the temporal operator X
The X operator before (t | w) means "next". So, X (t | w) translates to "in the next state, t or w is true".

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Refining the translation: The formula X (t | w) is satisfied if, in the state immediately following the current one, either t is true, w is true, or both are true. It imposes a constraint on the system that at least one of the conditions t or w must be met in the next state.

## 6: Final Translation
The LTL formula X (t | w) translates to: "In the next state, t or w (or both) must be true."

The final answer is: $\boxed{In the next state, at least one of t or w must be true.}$
