## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: X a & !G b

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To understand the formula, we break it down into its components:
- X a (Next a)
- !G b (Not always b)

The parsing tree can be represented as:
- X a & !G b
  - & (And)
    - X a
    - !G b
      - ! (Not)
      - G b (Always b)

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- G b means "always b", or "b is true at all time steps".
- !G b means "not always b", or "it is not the case that b is true at all time steps". This implies that there exists at least one time step where b is false.
- X a means "next a", or "a is true at the next time step".

## 4: Combine the meanings
The formula X a & !G b combines these meanings with an "and", so both conditions must be true:
- The system must have a at the next time step (X a).
- There must exist a time step where b is false (!G b).

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Combining these conditions into natural language:
- "The system will have a at the next time step, and there will be a time when b is false."

Or, for better clarity and readability:
- "At the next time step, a must be true, and at some point in the future, b will be false."

This phrasing captures the essence of both the next condition (X a) and the eventuality condition (!G b), making it clear what the system must satisfy over time.

The final answer is: $\boxed{At the next time step, a must be true, and at some point in the future, b will be false.}$
