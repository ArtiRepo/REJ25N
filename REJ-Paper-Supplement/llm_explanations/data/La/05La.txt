## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: X a & b.

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula X a & b, we first identify its components:
- X: Next time (or Next operator)
- a: Proposition a
- &: Conjunction (and)
- b: Proposition b

The parsing tree can be represented as:
```
    X a & b
   /     \
  X(a)    b
 /       \
X       a & b
```

However, a more accurate representation considering the scope of the next operator (X) would directly apply to 'a' and the conjunction with 'b' is considered at the same level as 'a' under the scope of X:
```
   X (a & b)
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- a & b means both a and b must be true.
- X (a & b) means that at the next time step, both a and b must be true.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula X (a & b) translates to: "At the next time step, a and b are both true."

This implies that for the system to satisfy this LTL formula, at any given point in time, it does not matter what the current state of a and b are, but at the very next time step, both a and b must simultaneously be in a true state.

## 5: Clarification on Satisfaction and Constraints
- **Satisfaction**: The formula X (a & b) is satisfied if, at the next time step after the current one, both propositions a and b are true. It does not impose any constraints on the current or any previous state.
- **Constraints on the System**: This formula imposes a constraint on the system that at any point in time, if the next state is considered, both a and b must be true. This means the system can be in any state now, but it must transition to a state where both a and b are true at the next step.

The final answer is: $\boxed{At the next time step, both a and b are true.}$
