## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: F x | F y.

## 2: Break down the subformula into a parsing tree
To break down the formula F x | F y into a parsing tree, we identify its components:
- The formula is a disjunction (OR, denoted by "|") of two subformulas: F x and F y.
- "F" denotes "Future", meaning that the proposition it precedes will be true at some point in the future.

## 3: Parsing Tree Structure
The parsing tree can be represented as:
```
     |
    / \
   F x  F y
```

## 4: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- F x means that x will be true at some point in the future.
- F y means that y will be true at some point in the future.
- The "|" operator between F x and F y means that at least one of these conditions needs to be true.

## 5: Combine the meanings
Combining these meanings, F x | F y means that either x will be true at some point in the future or y will be true at some point in the future (or both).

## 6: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Refining the natural language phrasing, we can say: "It will eventually be the case that x or y (or both) is true."

## 7: Final Translation and Explanation
The LTL formula F x | F y is satisfied if, over time, the system reaches a state where either x is true or y is true (or both). This formula imposes a constraint on the system that at least one of the propositions x or y must become true at some future point. If neither x nor y ever becomes true, the formula is not satisfied.

The final answer is: $\boxed{It will eventually be the case that x or y (or both) is true.}$
