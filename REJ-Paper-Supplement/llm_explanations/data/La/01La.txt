## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: $X a \Rightarrow X c$

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- $a$ and $c$ are atomic propositions.
- $X$ is the next-time operator, which means "in the next state".
- $\Rightarrow$ is the implication operator.

The parsing tree can be represented as:
- Root: $\Rightarrow$
  - Left child: $X a$
  - Right child: $X c$

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $X a$ means "in the next state, $a$ is true".
- $X c$ means "in the next state, $c$ is true".
- The implication $\Rightarrow$ between $X a$ and $X c$ means that if the left side is true, the right side must also be true.

## 4: Analyze the implication
The implication $X a \Rightarrow X c$ is false only when $X a$ is true and $X c$ is false. This means the formula is false if in the next state, $a$ is true but $c$ is false.

## 5: Determine when the formula is satisfied
The formula $X a \Rightarrow X c$ is satisfied (or true) in the following scenarios:
- If in the current state, $a$ is false (because $X a$ would be false, making the implication true regardless of $c$).
- If in the next state, $c$ is true (regardless of $a$'s truth value in the next state, because if $a$ is true, $c$ being true satisfies the implication).

## 6: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The natural language translation of $X a \Rightarrow X c$ can be refined as: "If $a$ becomes true in the next state, then $c$ must also become true in the next state."

Alternatively, a more fluid translation could be: "Whenever $a$ starts being true in the next moment, $c$ must start being true in the next moment as well."

This captures the essence that if $a$'s truth value switches to true in the next state, $c$'s truth value must also switch to true in the next state to satisfy the formula. If $a$ does not become true, or if $c$ also becomes true alongside $a$, the formula is satisfied.

The final answer is: $\boxed{If $a$ becomes true in the next state, then $c$ must also become true in the next state.}$
