## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: X (t & y)

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- X: Next (a temporal operator meaning "in the next state")
- t & y: A conjunction of two propositions, t and y, meaning "t and y"

The parsing tree can be represented as:
```
  X
 / 
(t & y)
```
Further breaking down (t & y):
```
   &
  / \
 t   y
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- t and y are propositions that can be true or false.
- The conjunction "&" means both t and y must be true for (t & y) to be true.
- The temporal operator X means that the condition it precedes must be true in the next state.

## 4: Combine the meaning to translate into natural language
Combining these meanings:
- For X (t & y) to be true, in the next state, both t and y must be true.

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Refining the translation:
- The formula X (t & y) can be translated to: "In the next state, t and y must both be true."
- Alternatively, it implies a constraint on the system: "It is required that in the immediate future, both conditions t and y are satisfied."

## 6: Explanation of satisfaction and constraints
- The formula is satisfied if, at any point in time, moving to the next state results in both t and y being true.
- It imposes a constraint on the system that at any point, if the next state is considered, both t and y must hold true for the system to be considered as satisfying the given LTL formula.

The final answer is: $\boxed{In the next state, both t and y must be true.}$
