## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: $X(!g | !j)$

## Step 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- $X$ is the "next" operator, indicating that the property it modifies holds at the next time step.
- $!g$ means "not $g$", where $g$ is a proposition.
- $!j$ means "not $j$", where $j$ is another proposition.
- $|$ denotes the logical OR operation.

The parsing tree can be represented as:
```
    X
   / 
  (!g | !j)
 /     \
!g      !j
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $!g$ is true if $g$ is false.
- $!j$ is true if $j$ is false.
- The expression $!g | !j$ is true if either $!g$ or $!j$ (or both) is true. This means it is true if either $g$ is false or $j$ is false (or both).

## 4: Apply the "next" operator $X$
The $X$ operator applies to the entire expression $!g | !j$, meaning that the truth of $!g | !j$ is considered at the next time step. So, $X(!g | !j)$ is true if at the next time step, either $g$ is false or $j$ is false (or both).

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula $X(!g | !j)$ can be translated into natural language as: "At the next time step, either $g$ is false or $j$ is false (or both)". 

This implies that the system must be in a state at the next time step where at least one of the propositions $g$ or $j$ is not true. It imposes a constraint on the system that it cannot have both $g$ and $j$ true at the same time, starting from the next step.

The final answer is: $\boxed{At the next time step, at least one of g or j is false.}$
