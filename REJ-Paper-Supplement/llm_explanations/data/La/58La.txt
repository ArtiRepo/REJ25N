## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: `!F(a and Xa and XXa)`

## Step 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- `a` is a proposition.
- `Xa` means `a` at the next state.
- `XXa` means `a` at the state after next.
- `F` is a temporal operator meaning "eventually".
- `!` is a negation operator.

The parsing tree can be represented as:
```
      !
       |
       F
      / \
     (a and Xa and XXa)
    /     |     \
   a     Xa     XXa
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- `a` is true at the current state.
- `Xa` is true if `a` is true at the next state.
- `XXa` is true if `a` is true at the state after next.

The subformula `a and Xa and XXa` means that `a` is true at the current state, and `a` is true at the next state, and `a` is true at the state after next.

## 4: Understanding the "eventually" operator `F`
The `F` operator means that the condition it prefixes will eventually become true at some point in the future.

So, `F(a and Xa and XXa)` means that eventually, there will be a state where `a` is true at that state, and `a` is true at the next state, and `a` is true at the state after next.

## 5: Apply the negation operator `!`
The negation operator `!` negates the condition that follows it. Therefore, `!F(a and Xa and XXa)` means that it is not the case that eventually, there will be a state where `a` is true at that state, and `a` is true at the next state, and `a` is true at the state after next.

## 6: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
To refine, we can say: "It is never the case that there will be a point in time where `a` is true and continues to be true for the next two time steps."

Or, more naturally: "`a` is never true for three consecutive time steps."

The final answer is: $\boxed{It is never the case that a is true for three consecutive time steps.}$
