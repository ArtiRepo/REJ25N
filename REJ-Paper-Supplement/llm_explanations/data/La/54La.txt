## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: $(a U b) \land G(a)$.

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- The formula is a conjunction ($\land$) of two parts: $(a U b)$ and $G(a)$.
- $(a U b)$ is an "until" formula, which means $a$ is true until $b$ becomes true.
- $G(a)$ is a "globally" formula, which means $a$ is true at all times.

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $G(a)$ means that $a$ must be true at all times (now and forever).
- $(a U b)$ means that $a$ is true until $b$ becomes true. If $b$ never becomes true, then $a$ must remain true forever for this part to be satisfied.

## 4: Combine the meanings
Combining these:
- For $(a U b) \land G(a)$ to be true, two conditions must be met:
  1. $a$ must be true globally ($G(a)$).
  2. $a$ must be true until $b$ becomes true ($(a U b)$).

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Given $G(a)$ requires $a$ to be true at all times, the until condition $(a U b)$ is automatically satisfied if $b$ eventually becomes true because $a$ being true until $b$ is a subset of $a$ being true always. However, if $b$ never becomes true, then $(a U b)$ is satisfied because $a$ remains true. But if $a$ ever becomes false, the whole formula fails because $G(a)$ is violated.

## 6: Final Translation
The LTL formula $(a U b) \land G(a)$ can be translated to natural language as: "$a$ is true at all times, and $a$ remains true until $b$ becomes true." However, given that $a$ must be true at all times due to $G(a)$, the critical implication is that $b$ may or may not become true, but if it does, it doesn't affect the truth of $a$. A more precise translation considering the logic would be: "$a$ is always true, and it remains that way until $b$ becomes true." But this can be simplified further because if $a$ is always true, the until condition is inherently satisfied regardless of $b$'s timing.

## 7: Simplification
A clearer way to phrase it, considering standard LTL interpretations, is: "$a$ is true forever, and $b$ will eventually become true while $a$ remains true." But given $a$ is forever, the emphasis is on $a$'s persistence and $b$'s eventuality. Yet, accurately, since $a$ must always be true, we focus on $b$'s condition being less restrictive because $a U b$ is satisfied by $a$ being always true regardless of $b$.

## 8: Final Clarification
The most straightforward natural language translation, ensuring accuracy with LTL semantics, is: "$a$ is always true and will remain true until $b$ is true." But given $a$'s universality, it simplifies understanding to say: "$a$ is always true."

The final answer is: $\boxed{a is always true}$
