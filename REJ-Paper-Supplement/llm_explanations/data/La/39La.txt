## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: $b U (d \& a)$.

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- The formula is $b U (d \& a)$.
- $b$ is a proposition.
- $U$ is the "until" operator, which means that $b$ must hold until the condition $(d \& a)$ is satisfied.
- $(d \& a)$ is a conjunction of propositions $d$ and $a$, meaning both $d$ and $a$ must be true.

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $(d \& a)$ is satisfied when both $d$ and $a$ are true at the same time.
- The $U$ operator indicates that $b$ must be true until $(d \& a)$ becomes true. This means $b$ has to hold in every state until the point when both $d$ and $a$ become true.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Given the breakdown and understanding:
- The formula $b U (d \& a)$ can be translated to: "$b$ must be true until both $d$ and $a$ are true."
- More naturally, it can be phrased as: "It must be the case that $b$ holds continuously until the point at which both $d$ and $a$ become true."

## 5: Clarify satisfaction conditions and constraints
- The formula is satisfied if $b$ is true in all states until the state where both $d$ and $a$ are true. 
- If $b$ becomes false at any point before both $d$ and $a$ are true, and remains false, the formula is not satisfied because $b$ is not holding until $(d \& a)$ is true.
- The formula imposes a constraint that $b$ must precede and include all time points until $d$ and $a$ simultaneously become true.

The final answer is: $\boxed{b must be true until both d and a are true}$
