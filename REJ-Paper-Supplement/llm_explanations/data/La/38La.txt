## Step 1: Write down original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: `(a U b) & (c U d)`.

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To understand the formula, we break it down into its components:
- The formula consists of two main parts connected by a conjunction (`&`): `(a U b)` and `(c U d)`.
- Each part is a "Until" (`U`) operator, which in LTL is defined as: `p U q` means `q` will eventually be true, and `p` will be true until then (including the present moment).

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- `a U b` means that `a` will be true until `b` becomes true. More precisely, it means `b` will eventually become true, and until that point, `a` must hold true. If `b` never becomes true, `a U b` is false.
- Similarly, `c U d` means that `c` will be true until `d` becomes true, with `d` eventually becoming true and `c` holding true until then.

## 4: Combine the meanings of the subformulas
The conjunction (`&`) between `(a U b)` and `(c U d)` means both conditions must be satisfied simultaneously.
- Therefore, `(a U b) & (c U d)` means that:
  - `a` must be true until `b` becomes true, and
  - `c` must be true until `d` becomes true.

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
In natural language, this can be phrased as: "The system must satisfy two conditions over time: 
- It must be the case that `a` holds true until `b` becomes true, and 
- It must be the case that `c` holds true until `d` becomes true."

Or more simply: "`a` must be true until `b` is true, and `c` must be true until `d` is true."

## 6: Clarify satisfaction and constraints
- The formula is satisfied if both `a U b` and `c U d` are satisfied. This means `b` and `d` must eventually become true, with `a` and `c` preceding them, respectively.
- It imposes constraints on the system that:
  - `a` and `c` cannot become false before `b` and `d` become true, respectively.
  - If `b` or `d` never become true, the formula is not satisfied because `a U b` or `c U d` (or both) would be false.

The final answer is: $\boxed{The system must have a be true until b is true, and c true until d is true.}$
