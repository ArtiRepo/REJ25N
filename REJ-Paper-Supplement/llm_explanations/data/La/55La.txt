## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: G(a -> (X!a and XXa))

## Step 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To parse the given LTL formula, we break it down into its components:
- The formula is G(φ), where φ = a -> ψ
- ψ = X!a and XXa
- Further breaking down ψ, we have:
  - X!a (next a is false, or a is not true in the next state)
  - XXa (a is true two steps from now)

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- X!a means that in the next state, a is false.
- XXa means that two steps from now, a is true.
- The conjunction X!a and XXa means that in the next state, a is false, and two steps from now, a is true.
- The implication a -> (X!a and XXa) means that if a is true in the current state, then in the next state, a must be false, and two steps from now, a must be true.

## 4: Interpret the G operator
- The G operator (always) means that the condition it precedes must hold true for all states from the current state onwards.
- Therefore, G(a -> (X!a and XXa)) means that for all states from now on, if a is true, then in the next state, a must be false, and two steps from now, a must be true.

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula G(a -> (X!a and XXa)) can be translated into natural language as:
"From now on, whenever a is true, it must be that a is false in the next state and a is true two states from now."

Or, more naturally:
"Whenever a becomes true, it must first become false and then become true again."

This captures the constraint that the system imposes on the proposition 'a' over time: 'a' cannot stay true or stay false indefinitely once it becomes true; it must toggle.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Whenever a becomes true, it must first become false and then become true again.}$
