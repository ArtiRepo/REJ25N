## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: G (n => s)

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula, we identify its components:
- G: Always (globally)
- n: A proposition (let's call it "n")
- =>: Implication
- s: Another proposition (let's call it "s")

The parsing tree can be represented as:
```
    G
   / \
  n   s
   \ /
    =>
```

However, a more accurate representation for parsing would consider the implication first:
```
     G
    / 
   =>
  /   \
 n     s
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- The implication "n => s" means "if n then s". This implication is true whenever n is false or s is true.

## 4: Apply the G operator
- The G operator means "always" or "globally". So, G (n => s) means that "always, if n then s".

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Putting it all together, G (n => s) can be translated to: "It is always the case that if n occurs, then s occurs."

## 6: Explain satisfaction and constraints
- This formula is satisfied if, at every point in time, either n is false or s is true (or both). 
- It imposes a constraint on the system that whenever n becomes true, s must also be true (or have been true since n became true and remain true). If n becomes true and s is not true, the formula is violated.

## 7: Final Natural Language Translation
The final translation in natural language, accounting for satisfaction and constraints over time, is: "Whenever n happens, s must happen."

The final answer is: $\boxed{Whenever n happens, s must happen.}$
