## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula is: G(a -> Fb)

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula G(a -> Fb), we first identify its components:
- G: Always (globally)
- a: A proposition (a statement that can be true or false)
- ->: Implication
- F: Eventually (future)
- b: Another proposition

The parsing tree breaks down as follows:
- The implication: a -> Fb
  - a is a proposition
  - Fb means "eventually b"
- The entire formula: G(a -> Fb) means "always (a implies eventually b)"

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- Fb is satisfied if b is true at some point in the future, not necessarily immediately.
- The implication a -> Fb is satisfied if:
  - a is false (since false implies anything is true), or
  - a is true and Fb is true (meaning b will be true at some point in the future).
- G(a -> Fb) is satisfied if the implication a -> Fb holds true at all times. This means that at any point in time:
  - If a is true, then b must become true at some point in the future (not necessarily immediately).
  - If a is false, there is no constraint imposed by this formula on b at that point.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
Given the breakdown and rebuilding:
- The formula G(a -> Fb) can be translated to: "Always, if a is true, then b will eventually be true."
- Alternatively, it can be phrased as: "Whenever a occurs, b will occur at some point in the future."
- Or more naturally: "If a happens, b will happen eventually."

## 5: Clarify when the formula imposes constraints on the system over time
The formula imposes a constraint that whenever proposition a is true, proposition b must become true at some future point. It does not require b to be true immediately after a, or even that a and b are ever both true at the same time, just that b's truth follows a's truth at some point. If a is never true, the formula does not impose any constraint on b.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Always, if a is true, then b will eventually be true.}$
