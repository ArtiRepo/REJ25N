## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: $b U !d$

## 2: Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
To break down the formula $b U !d$, we identify its components:
- $b$ is a proposition.
- $!d$ is the negation of proposition $d$.
- $U$ is the "until" operator, which means that the first argument must hold until the second argument becomes true.

The parsing tree can be seen as:
```
  b U !d
 /     \
b       !d
       / \
      d   !
```

## 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $!d$ means "$d$ is false" or "it is not the case that $d$".
- The $U$ operator implies that $b$ must be true until $!d$ becomes true.

## 4: Combine the meaning of the components
The formula $b U !d$ can be understood as: "$b$ must be true until $d$ becomes false". This means that as long as $d$ is true, $b$ must be true. The moment $d$ becomes false, the condition is satisfied regardless of $b$'s truth value from that point onwards.

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
A clearer natural language translation could be: "The system must satisfy $b$ at all times until $d$ becomes false". This emphasizes that $b$ needs to hold as long as $d$ is true, and once $d$ becomes false, there's no further requirement on $b$ due to this specific formula.

The final answer is: $\boxed{b must hold until d becomes false}$
