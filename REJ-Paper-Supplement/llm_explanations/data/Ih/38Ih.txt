Original LTL formula: `(a U b) & (c U d)`

Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:
*   `a U b`: This subformula means that `b` must eventually become true. Until `b` becomes true, `a` must be true in every state. Once `b` becomes true, `a` is no longer constrained by this specific part of the formula.
*   `c U d`: This subformula means that `d` must eventually become true. Until `d` becomes true, `c` must be true in every state. Once `d` becomes true, `c` is no longer constrained by this specific part of the formula.
*   `(a U b) & (c U d)`: The entire formula requires that both `a U b` and `c U d` must hold true simultaneously throughout the execution.

Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:
This formula imposes two independent sets of constraints that must both be satisfied throughout the system's execution.

1.  **First Condition (`a U b`):** This condition requires that `b` must eventually become true at some point in the future. Until that specific moment, `a` must be true in the current state and every subsequent state.
    *   *Constraints:* `a` is constrained to be true in all states until `b` is observed. `b` is constrained to eventually occur.
    *   *Satisfaction:* This condition is satisfied if `b` eventually occurs, and `a` holds continuously in all states from the current state up to and including the state where `b` first becomes true.
    *   *Cessation of Constraints:* Once `b` becomes true, the constraint on `a` from this part of the formula no longer applies.

2.  **Second Condition (`c U d`):** This condition requires that `d` must eventually become true at some point in the future. Until that specific moment, `c` must be true in the current state and every subsequent state.
    *   *Constraints:* `c` is constrained to be true in all states until `d` is observed. `d` is constrained to eventually occur.
    *   *Satisfaction:* This condition is satisfied if `d` eventually occurs, and `c` holds continuously in all states from the current state up to and including the state where `d` first becomes true.
    *   *Cessation of Constraints:* Once `d` becomes true, the constraint on `c` from this part of the formula no longer applies.

The entire formula `(a U b) & (c U d)` is satisfied only if *both* the first and second conditions are met. If `a` becomes false before `b` occurs, or if `b` never occurs, *or* if `c` becomes false before `d` occurs, or if `d` never occurs, then the entire formula is violated. The timing of `b` and `d` becoming true is independent; one can occur before the other, or they can occur simultaneously.
