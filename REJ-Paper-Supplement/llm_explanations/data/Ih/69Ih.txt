Original LTL formula: `FGa`

Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:
1.  `a`: "a must be true in the current state and is otherwise unconstrained."
2.  `Ga`: "a must be true in every state of the execution." This means that from the current state onwards, `a` must always hold.
3.  `F(Ga)`: "There must exist at least one future state where `Ga` is true." This means there must be some point in the execution where the condition "a must be true in every state of the execution" becomes true.

Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:
The formula `FGa` means: "Eventually, `a` must become true and remain true indefinitely from that point onwards."

**Explanation:**

*   **When the formula imposes constraints:**
    *   Initially, `FGa` does not impose an immediate constraint on `a` in the current state. `a` can be true or false.
    *   The constraint is that the system must eventually reach a state where `a` becomes permanently true. Until that state is reached, the formula is "waiting" for `a` to stabilize to true.
    *   Once a state `s_k` is reached where `a` is true, and `a` remains true in all subsequent states (`s_{k+1}, s_{k+2}, ...`), the formula `FGa` is satisfied. From that moment on, this specific formula no longer imposes further constraints, as its condition has been met.

*   **How the formula is evaluated:**
    *   At any given state, the system checks if `Ga` is true *from that state onwards*. If `Ga` is true (meaning `a` is true in the current state and all future states), then `FGa` is satisfied immediately.
    *   If `Ga` is not true in the current state, the system looks to the next state, and the next, and so on, to see if `Ga` ever becomes true. If it does, `FGa` is satisfied. If the end of the execution is reached without `Ga` ever becoming true, then `FGa` is violated.

*   **Satisfying sequences:**
    *   `a, a, a, a, ...`: `Ga` is true from the very first state, so `FGa` is satisfied immediately.
    *   `!a, !a, a, a, a, ...`: `Ga` becomes true at the third state, satisfying `FGa`.
    *   `!a, a, a, a, ...`: `Ga` becomes true at the second state, satisfying `FGa`.

*   **Violating sequences:**
    *   `!a, !a, !a, !a, ...`: `a` never becomes true, so `Ga` is never true.
    *   `a, !a, a, !a, ...`: `a` never remains true indefinitely; it always eventually becomes false again.
    *   `!a, a, !a, a, ...`: Similar to the above, `a` never stabilizes to true.

*   **Potential misunderstandings:** A common misunderstanding is that `a` must be true *now* or *always*. This is incorrect. `FGa` allows `a` to be false for an arbitrary period, but it mandates that `a` must eventually become true and then *never become false again*. The constraint applies until `a` permanently holds, and then it ceases.
