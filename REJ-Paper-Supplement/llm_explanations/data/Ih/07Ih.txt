**Original LTL formula**
a U c

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up**
The formula `a U c` means that `c` must eventually become true. Until that specific state where `c` becomes true, `a` must be true in every preceding state. Once `c` is true, the condition on `a` no longer applies.

**Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity.**
This formula states that `c` must eventually become true at some point in the future. Until that exact moment `c` becomes true, `a` must be continuously true in every state.

*   **When the formula imposes constraints:**
    *   From the current state onwards, the system is constrained to ensure that `c` will eventually be true.
    *   In every state *before* `c` becomes true, `a` is constrained to be true.
*   **When the constraints no longer apply:**
    *   Once `c` becomes true in a state, the formula is satisfied, and no further constraints are imposed on `a` or `c` by this specific formula.
*   **Satisfying sequences:**
    *   If `c` is true in the current state, the formula is immediately satisfied. (e.g., `c` is true)
    *   If `a` is true in the current state, and `c` is true in the next state, the formula is satisfied. (e.g., `a`, `c`)
    *   If `a` is true in the current state, `a` is true in the next state, and `c` is true in the state after that, the formula is satisfied. (e.g., `a`, `a`, `c`)
*   **Violating sequences:**
    *   If `a` is false in any state *before* `c` becomes true, the formula is violated. (e.g., `!a`, `c`)
    *   If `c` never becomes true at any point in the future, the formula is violated, regardless of whether `a` was continuously true or not. (e.g., `a`, `a`, `a`, ...)
*   **Potential misunderstandings:** It's crucial that `a` holds *continuously* until `c` is true. If `a` becomes false even for one state before `c` appears, the formula is violated. Also, `c` is *guaranteed* to happen; it's not optional.
