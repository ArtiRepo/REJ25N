**Original LTL formula**
`X a & b`

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up**
1.  **`b`**: This atomic proposition asserts that `b` must be true in the current state. It imposes an immediate constraint on the current state and is otherwise unconstrained.
2.  **`X a`**: This temporal operator asserts that `a` must be true in the very next state. It imposes a constraint on the state immediately following the current one.
3.  **`X a & b`**: This is a conjunction of the two previous conditions. For the entire formula to be true, both `b` must be true in the current state AND `a` must be true in the very next state.

**Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity.**
This formula asserts two conditions that must hold simultaneously:
1.  **Immediately:** The proposition `b` must be true in the current state. This is an immediate constraint that is evaluated at the moment the formula is checked.
2.  **In the very next state:** The proposition `a` must be true in the state that immediately follows the current state. This imposes a constraint on the future, specifically on the next state.

The formula `X a & b` is satisfied if and only if `b` is true in the current state AND `a` is true in the subsequent state. If either `b` is false in the current state, or `a` is false in the very next state, then the formula is violated.

The constraints imposed by this formula are very specific and short-lived:
*   The constraint on `b` applies only to the current state.
*   The constraint on `a` applies only to the single, immediate next state.
Once the system transitions to the next state, the truth value of `X a & b` (as evaluated from the original current state) is definitively determined. It does not impose any further constraints on states beyond the next one.

A common misunderstanding is to interpret this as `X (a & b)`, which would mean that both `a` and `b` must be true in the next state. However, due to the operator precedence, `b` is evaluated in the current state, while `a` is evaluated in the next state.
