**Original LTL formula:**
`(b | !a) & X (d U c)`

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:**

1.  **`!a`**: This means that proposition `a` must be false in the current state.
2.  **`b | !a`**: This means that in the current state, either proposition `b` must be true, or proposition `a` must be false (or both). This part of the formula imposes an immediate constraint on the current state.
3.  **`d U c`**: This is an "Until" operator. For this subformula to be true, two conditions must be met:
    *   Proposition `c` must eventually become true at some point in the future.
    *   Until that specific state where `c` becomes true, proposition `d` must be true in every state leading up to it. Once `c` becomes true, the requirement for `d` to hold ceases. This subformula describes a sequence of events over time.
4.  **`X (d U c)`**: The `X` (Next) operator means that the condition `(d U c)` must hold starting from the *very next state*. This means that from the next state onwards, `c` must eventually become true, and until `c` becomes true, `d` must be true in every state. This part of the formula imposes a constraint on the future, starting one step from the current state.
5.  **`(b | !a) & X (d U c)`**: This is a conjunction (`&`), meaning both parts must be true simultaneously for the entire formula to be satisfied.
    *   The first part `(b | !a)` imposes an immediate constraint on the current state.
    *   The second part `X (d U c)` imposes a constraint on the future, starting from the next state.

**Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:**

This formula imposes two distinct conditions that must both be met for it to be satisfied.

First, **in the current state**, it must be true that either `b` is true or `a` is false. This is an immediate constraint that is checked at the moment the formula is evaluated. If this condition is not met in the current state, the entire formula is false.

Second, **looking ahead from the current state**, a specific sequence of events must begin in the very next state and continue into the future. Specifically, starting from the next state:
*   `c` must eventually become true at some point in the future.
*   Until that specific moment when `c` becomes true, `d` must remain true in every state.
*   Once `c` becomes true, the constraint for `d` to hold is satisfied and no longer applies.

Therefore, for the formula to be satisfied, the current state must meet the `(b | !a)` condition, AND the subsequent execution path (starting from the next state) must ensure that `c` eventually occurs, with `d` holding continuously until `c` does. If `c` never becomes true, or if `d` becomes false before `c` becomes true (starting from the next state), then the second part of the formula is violated, making the entire formula false.
