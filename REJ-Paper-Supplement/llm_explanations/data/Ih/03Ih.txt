**Original LTL formula:**
`a & X b`

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:**
*   `a`: This means that proposition `a` must be true in the current state. It imposes no constraints on `a` in any other state.
*   `X b`: This means that proposition `b` must be true in the very next state immediately following the current state. It imposes no constraints on `b` in any other state.
*   `a & X b`: The `&` (AND) operator requires both conditions to be true *at the point of evaluation*. Therefore, `a` must be true in the current state, AND `b` must be true in the very next state.

**Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:**
This formula states that **`a` must be true in the current state, AND `b` must be true in the very next state.**

*   **Constraints:** The formula imposes two distinct constraints:
    1.  An immediate constraint that `a` must be true in the current state.
    2.  A forward-looking constraint that `b` must be true in the state directly following the current one.
*   **Evaluation and Evolution:** When evaluated at a specific state, the formula checks if `a` is true in that state and if `b` is true in the subsequent state. If both conditions hold, the formula is satisfied for that evaluation point.
*   **Immediate vs. Ongoing:** The satisfaction of `a` is an immediate check in the current state. The satisfaction of `X b` is a check on the state immediately following. Once these two states have passed, this specific instance of the formula (evaluated at the initial state) has either been satisfied or violated, and it imposes no further ongoing constraints on the system.
*   **Satisfying Sequence:** A sequence like `(a=T, b=F)` followed by `(a=F, b=T)` satisfies the formula when evaluated at the first state. Here, `a` is true in the first state, and `b` is true in the second state.
*   **Violating Sequence:**
    *   A sequence like `(a=F, b=T)` followed by `(a=T, b=F)` violates the formula because `a` is false in the current state.
    *   A sequence like `(a=T, b=F)` followed by `(a=T, b=F)` violates the formula because `b` is false in the very next state.
*   **Potential Misunderstanding:** It is important to note that `a` is only constrained to be true in the *current* state, and `b` is only constrained to be true in the *next* state. This formula does not require `a` to remain true, nor `b` to be true, in any other state beyond these specific points in time.
