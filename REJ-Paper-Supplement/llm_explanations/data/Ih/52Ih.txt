**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up**

*   **`a`**: This proposition requires `a` to be true in a specific state. It imposes a constraint only on the truth value of `a` in that particular state.

*   **`Fa`**: This means "There must exist at least one future state where `a` is true."
    *   This formula imposes an ongoing constraint from the current state. It requires that `a` eventually becomes true at some point in the current state or any subsequent state.
    *   It is satisfied if `a` is true in the current state, or if `a` becomes true in any future state. Once `a` becomes true, the requirement of `Fa` is met, and no further constraint is imposed by `Fa` regarding `a`'s future truth value.
    *   It is violated if `a` is false in the current state and remains false in all subsequent states.

*   **`X(Fa)`**: This means "In the very next state, `Fa` must be true."
    *   This formula imposes an immediate constraint on the system's behavior in the very next state.
    *   Specifically, it requires that in the state immediately following the current one, the condition "there must exist at least one future state where `a` is true" must hold. This means that from the perspective of the next state, `a` must eventually become true.
    *   It is satisfied if, when the system transitions to the next state, `a` is true in that next state, or `a` becomes true in any state after that next state.
    *   It is violated if, in the next state, `a` is false and remains false in all subsequent states from that point onwards.
    *   The `X` operator's constraint is met or violated upon entering the next state. The `Fa` part then imposes its ongoing constraint from that next state until `a` becomes true.

*   **`X(X(Fa))` (which is `XXFa`)**: This means "In the very next state, `X(Fa)` must be true."
    *   This formula imposes an immediate constraint on the system's behavior, specifically concerning the state *two steps* from the current state.
    *   It requires that in the state immediately following the current one, the condition "in the very next state (relative to that state), `Fa` must be true" must hold.
    *   Combining these, it means that in the state *two steps from now*, the condition "there must exist at least one future state where `a` is true" must hold.
    *   Therefore, from the current state, this formula requires that in the state that occurs two steps into the future, `a` must eventually become true.
    *   It is satisfied if, when the system reaches the state two steps from now, `a` is true in that state, or `a` becomes true in any state after that state (from the perspective of the state two steps from now).
    *   It is violated if, in the state two steps from now, `a` is false and remains false in all subsequent states from that point onwards.
    *   The `XX` operators' constraints are met or violated upon entering the state two steps from now. The `Fa` part then imposes its ongoing constraint from that state (two steps from now) until `a` becomes true.

**Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity**

"In the state that occurs two steps from the current moment, it must eventually be the case that `a` is true."
