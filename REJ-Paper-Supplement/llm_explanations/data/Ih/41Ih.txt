**Original LTL formula:**
G (n => s)

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:**
1.  `n => s`: This propositional implication means that in any given state, if `n` is true, then `s` must also be true in that same state. If `n` is false, this implication is true regardless of `s`.
2.  `G (n => s)`: The `G` (Globally) operator means that the condition `(n => s)` must hold true in *every* state of the execution, from the initial state onwards.

**Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:**
This formula states that in every state of the execution, if `n` is true, then `s` must also be true in that same state.

The formula imposes a continuous constraint: at any point in time, if `n` is observed to be true, `s` must simultaneously be true. If `n` is false in a given state, the formula imposes no constraint on `s` in that specific state, and the condition `n => s` is considered satisfied for that state.

The formula is satisfied if, for every state in the execution, whenever `n` is true, `s` is also true. It is violated if there exists at least one state where `n` is true but `s` is false. The constraints imposed by this formula apply throughout the entire execution and never cease.
