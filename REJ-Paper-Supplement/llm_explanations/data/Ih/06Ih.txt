Original LTL formula:
`X !b & d`

Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:
*   `!b`: `b` is false.
*   `X !b`: In the very next state, `b` is false.
*   `d`: `d` is true in the current state.
*   `X !b & d`: Both `d` is true in the current state AND in the very next state, `b` is false.

Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:
This formula states that two conditions must hold simultaneously in the current state for the formula to be satisfied: `d` must be true in the current state, and `b` must be false in the very next state.

When the formula `X !b & d` is evaluated in the current state, it imposes an immediate constraint that `d` must be true *now*. Simultaneously, it imposes a look-ahead constraint that `b` must be false in the *next* state. If both of these conditions are met, the formula is satisfied in the current state.

**Constraints over time:**
The constraint on `d` is strictly immediate; it applies only to the current state and does not impose any conditions on `d` in future states. The constraint on `b` is strictly for the very next state; it does not apply to the current state or any states beyond the next one. Once the next state has occurred, the specific constraints imposed by this instance of the formula are fully evaluated and no longer apply to subsequent states.

**Satisfying and violating sequences:**
For example, a sequence where the current state is `(d=true, b=any)` and the next state is `(b=false, d=any)` would satisfy the formula. Conversely, if `d` is false in the current state, the formula is immediately violated. If `d` is true in the current state but `b` is true in the very next state, the formula is also violated.

**Potential misunderstandings:**
It is crucial to understand that this formula does not constrain `d` in the next state, nor does it constrain `b` in the current state or any state after the next. The constraints are precisely limited to `d` in the current state and `b` in the immediate next state.
