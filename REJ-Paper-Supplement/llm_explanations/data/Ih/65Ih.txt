Original LTL formula:
`Xa U Xb`

Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:
1.  **`Xa`**: This subformula means "a must be true in the very next state." When evaluated at any state `s_i`, it imposes a constraint on `s_{i+1}`.
2.  **`Xb`**: This subformula means "b must be true in the very next state." When evaluated at any state `s_i`, it imposes a constraint on `s_{i+1}`.
3.  **`Xa U Xb`**: This is an Until operator where the first operand is `Xa` and the second is `Xb`. When evaluated at the current state `s_0`, it requires:
    *   There must exist a future state `s_k` (where `k >= 0`) such that the second operand, `Xb`, is true at `s_k`. This means `b` must be true in state `s_{k+1}`.
    *   For all states `s_i` from `s_0` up to `s_k-1` (if `k > 0`), the first operand, `Xa`, must be true at `s_i`. This means `a` must be true in state `s_{i+1}`.

Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:
This formula, evaluated at the current state `s_0`, imposes constraints on future states, starting from the very next state.

It requires that there must exist a future state `s_k` (relative to the current state) such that `b` is true in the state immediately following `s_k` (i.e., `s_{k+1}`). Additionally, `a` must be true in every state from `s_1` up to `s_k`.

*   **Satisfaction:** The formula is satisfied if `b` becomes true in `s_{k+1}` at some point, and `a` was true in all states `s_1` through `s_k` leading up to that point. Once `b` is true in `s_{k+1}`, the formula is satisfied, and no further constraints are imposed by this specific instance of `Xa U Xb`.
*   **Violation:** The formula is violated if `b` never becomes true in any `s_{k+1}` throughout the execution, or if `a` is false in any state `s_j` (where `1 <= j <= k`) *before* `b` becomes true in `s_{k+1}`.
*   **Constraints over time:** The constraint for `a` to be true in the next state applies continuously until the state `s_k` is reached where `b` is true in `s_{k+1}`. If `a` fails to hold in any `s_j` before `b` holds in `s_{k+1}`, the formula is violated. If `b` never holds in any `s_{k+1}`, the formula is also violated.
