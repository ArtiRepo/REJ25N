Certainly! Let's break down the process of translating the LTL formula \(X a \Rightarrow X c\) into structured natural language.
 

 ### 1. Write down the original LTL formula
 The original formula is:
 \[ X a \Rightarrow X c \]
 

 ### 2. Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
 To understand the formula, we can break it down into its components:
 

 ```
  =>
  / \
  X a X c
 ```
 

 - The root of the tree is the implication operator (\(\Rightarrow\)).
 - The left child is \(X a\), which means "in the next moment, \(a\) holds."
 - The right child is \(X c\), which means "in the next moment, \(c\) holds."
 

 ### 3. Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
 - **\(X a\):** "In the next moment of the system execution, \(a\) should hold."
 - **\(X c\):** "In the next moment of the system execution, \(c\) should hold."
 - **\(X a \Rightarrow X c\):** "If in the next moment \(a\) holds, then in the next moment \(c\) should also hold."
 

 ### 4. Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
 Combining these interpretations, we can refine the natural language translation:
 

 

 This phrasing captures the conditional nature of the implication and the temporal aspect of the "next moment" as specified by the \(X\) (next) operator.
