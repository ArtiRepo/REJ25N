Certainly! Let's go through the process of translating the given LTL formula into structured natural language.
 

 ### 1. Write down the original LTL formula
 The original LTL formula is:  
 \((b \lor \neg a) \land X (d \, U \, c)\)
 

 ### 2. Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
 Let's break down the formula into its components:
 

 - **Root:** \(\land\) (AND)
  - **Left Subformula:** \(b \lor \neg a\) (OR)
  - **Left Leaf:** \(b\)
  - **Right Leaf:** \(\neg a\) (NOT)
  - **Leaf:** \(a\)
  - **Right Subformula:** \(X (d \, U \, c)\) (Next)
  - **Subformula:** \(d \, U \, c\) (Until)
  - **Left Leaf:** \(d\)
  - **Right Leaf:** \(c\)
 

 ### 3. Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
 - **Leaf \(b\):** The proposition \(b\) holds.
 - **Leaf \(\neg a\):** The proposition \(a\) does not hold.
 - **Subformula \(b \lor \neg a\):** Either \(b\) holds or \(a\) does not hold.
 - **Leaf \(d\):** The proposition \(d\) holds.
 - **Leaf \(c\):** The proposition \(c\) holds.
 - **Subformula \(d \, U \, c\):** \(d\) holds continuously until \(c\) holds.
 - **Subformula \(X (d \, U \, c)\):** In the next moment, \(d\) will hold continuously until \(c\) holds.
 - **Root \((b \lor \neg a) \land X (d \, U \, c)\):** Both the subformula \(b \lor \neg a\) and the subformula \(X (d \, U \, c)\) must hold.
 

 ### 4. Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
 "In the current moment of the system execution, either \(b\) must hold or \(a\) must not hold. Additionally, in the next moment of the system execution, \(d\) must hold continuously until \(c\) holds."
 

 This structured approach helps in understanding the logical flow and temporal requirements specified by the LTL formula.
