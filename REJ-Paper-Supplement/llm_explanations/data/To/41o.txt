Certainly! Let's break down the LTL formula and translate it into structured natural language.
 

 ### 1. Write down the original LTL formula
 \[ G (n \Rightarrow s) \]
 

 ### 2. Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
 - **G (Globally)**
  - **(n \Rightarrow s)**
  - **n (Condition n)**
  - **s (Condition s)**
 

 ### 3. Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
 - **n \Rightarrow s**: This subformula means "if condition n holds, then condition s must also hold."
 - **G (Globally)**: This operator means that the subformula it applies to must hold at all times throughout the system execution.
 

 ### 4. Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
 Putting it all together, the formula \( G (n \Rightarrow s) \) can be translated into structured natural language as:
 

 "Throughout the entire execution of the system, whenever condition n holds, condition s must also hold."
 

 This translation captures the essence of the LTL formula by expressing the global requirement that the implication \( n \Rightarrow s \) must be true at every point in time during the system's operation.
