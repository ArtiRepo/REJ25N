Certainly! Let's go through the process of translating the LTL formula \( G (\neg f \lor \neg i) \) into structured natural language.
 

 ### 1. Write down the original LTL formula
 The original LTL formula is:
 \[ G (\neg f \lor \neg i) \]
 

 ### 2. Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
 Let's break down the formula into its components:
 

 - **G**: Globally (always)
  - **Subformula**: \( \neg f \lor \neg i \)
  - **\(\neg f\)**: Not \( f \)
  - **\(\lor\)**: Or
  - **\(\neg i\)**: Not \( i \)
 

 ### 3. Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
 - **\(\neg f\)**: The condition \( f \) does not hold.
 - **\(\neg i\)**: The condition \( i \) does not hold.
 - **\(\neg f \lor \neg i\)**: Either \( f \) does not hold, or \( i \) does not hold (or both do not hold).
 - **G (\neg f \lor \neg i)**: Globally (at all times), either \( f \) does not hold, or \( i \) does not hold (or both do not hold).
 

 ### 4. Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
 The formula \( G (\neg f \lor \neg i) \) can be translated into structured natural language as:
 "At all times during the system execution, either condition \( f \) must not hold, or condition \( i \) must not hold, or both conditions must not hold."
 

 This translation captures the essence of the LTL formula by emphasizing the global nature of the requirement and the disjunctive condition between \( f \) and \( i \).
