Original LTL formula: X(!g | !j) Breakdown (parsing tree): Root: X (next) Child: (!g | !j) (disjunction) Left child: !g (not g) Right child: !j (not j) Rebuild meaning from the bottom up: !g means "g does not hold." !j means "j does not hold." !g | !j  means "at least one of g or j does not hold." X(!g | !j) means "in the next moment, at least one of g or j must not hold." Refined natural language phrasing: "In the next moment of system execution, either g must not hold or j must not hold (or both)."
