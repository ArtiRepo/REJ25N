Certainly! Let's go through the process of translating the given LTL formula into structured natural language.
 

 ### 1. Write down the original LTL formula
 The formula is:  
 \[(d \lor \neg b) \, \mathcal{U} \, \neg a\]
 

 ### 2. Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
 The parsing tree for this formula can be broken down as follows:
 

 - **Until Operator (\(\mathcal{U}\))**: This is the main operator.
  - **Left Operand**: \(d \lor \neg b\)
  - **Sub-operand 1**: \(d\)
  - **Sub-operand 2**: \(\neg b\)
  - **Right Operand**: \(\neg a\)
 

 ### 3. Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
 - **Sub-operand 1**: \(d\) means "condition \(d\) holds."
 - **Sub-operand 2**: \(\neg b\) means "condition \(b\) does not hold."
 - **Left Operand**: \(d \lor \neg b\) means "either condition \(d\) holds or condition \(b\) does not hold."
 - **Right Operand**: \(\neg a\) means "condition \(a\) does not hold."
 - **Until Operator**: \((d \lor \neg b) \, \mathcal{U} \, \neg a\) means "the condition \((d \lor \neg b)\) must hold continuously until condition \(\neg a\) becomes true."
 

 ### 4. Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
 "In the system execution, either condition \(d\) must hold or condition \(b\) must not hold continuously until condition \(a\) does not hold."
 

 This structured approach helps in understanding how each part of the LTL formula contributes to the overall meaning, allowing for a clear translation into natural language.
