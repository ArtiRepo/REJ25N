Certainly! Let's go through the process of translating the LTL formula \(!G c\) into structured natural language.
 

 ### 1. Write down the original LTL formula
 \[
 !G c
 \]
 

 ### 2. Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
 - **Root**: !
  - **Child**: G
  - **Child**: c
 

 ### 3. Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
 - **c**: This is a proposition that represents some condition or event in the system.
 - **G c**: The operator \(G\) stands for "Globally," meaning that the condition \(c\) should hold at all times throughout the system's execution.
 - **!G c**: The negation operator \(!\) inverts the meaning of \(G c\). Therefore, \(!G c\) means that it is not the case that \(c\) holds globally.
 

 ### 4. Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
 "In the system execution, it is not true that condition \(c\) holds at all times."
 

 This means that there exists at least one moment in the system execution where \(c\) does not hold.
