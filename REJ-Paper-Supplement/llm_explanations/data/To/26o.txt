Certainly! Let's break down the process of translating the given LTL formula into structured natural language.
 

 ### 1. Write down the original LTL formula
 The original LTL formula is:  
 \[ X t \Rightarrow X y \]
 

 ### 2. Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
 The parsing tree for this formula can be visualized as follows:
 

 ```
  =>
  / \
  X t X y
 ```
 

 - The root of the tree is the implication operator (\(\Rightarrow\)).
 - The left child of the root is the temporal operator \(X\) applied to proposition \(t\).
 - The right child of the root is the temporal operator \(X\) applied to proposition \(y\).
 

 ### 3. Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
 - **\(X t\):** This means "in the next moment of the system execution, \(t\) has to hold."
 - **\(X y\):** This means "in the next moment of the system execution, \(y\) has to hold."
 - **\(X t \Rightarrow X y\):** This implies that "if in the next moment \(t\) holds, then in the next moment \(y\) must also hold."
 

 ### 4. Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
 Combining these interpretations, the structured natural language translation of the formula is:
 "In the next moment of the system execution, if \(t\) holds, then \(y\) must also hold in that same next moment."
 

 This translation captures the conditional nature of the implication, focusing on the temporal aspect of both propositions occurring in the next moment of execution.
