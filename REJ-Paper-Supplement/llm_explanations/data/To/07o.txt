Certainly! Let's go through the process of translating the LTL formula \( a \, U \, c \) into structured natural language.
 

 ### 1. Write down the original LTL formula
 - **LTL Formula:** \( a \, U \, c \)
 

 ### 2. Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)
 - **Root:** \( U \) (Until)
  - **Left Child:** \( a \)
  - **Right Child:** \( c \)
 

 ### 3. Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
 - **Leaf Nodes:** 
  - \( a \): A condition or proposition that holds at a given moment.
  - \( c \): Another condition or proposition that holds at a given moment.
  
 - **Root Node (Until Operator \( U \)):** 
  - The formula \( a \, U \, c \) means that condition \( a \) must hold continuously until condition \( c \) becomes true. Once \( c \) becomes true, \( a \) no longer needs to hold.
 

 ### 4. Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
 - **Structured Natural Language Translation:**
  - "Condition \( a \) must hold at every moment until condition \( c \) becomes true. Once \( c \) is true, \( a \) does not need to hold anymore."
 

 This structured approach helps in understanding how each part of the formula contributes to its overall meaning, allowing for a clear and precise translation into natural language.
