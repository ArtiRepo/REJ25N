**Original LTL formula**

\[
(b \;|\; \neg a)\ \&\ X\,( d\;U\;c)
\]

### Bottom‑up reconstruction

| Sub‑formula | Meaning (bottom up) |
|-------------|---------------------|
| \(d\;U\;c\) | “\(c\) has to become true at some future point, and until that point \(d\) must be true in every state. After \(c\) becomes true, the requirement on \(d\) disappears.” |
| \(X(d\;U\;c)\) | “In the very next state, the property \(d\;U\;c\) must hold.” Thus, from the next state onward, \(d\) must stay true until a future state where \(c\) is true. |
| \(b \;|\; \neg a\) | “At the current state, either \(b\) is true, or \(a\) is false (equivalently, \(a\) is not true).” This is a constraint that only applies to the current state. |
| \((b \;|\; \neg a)\ \&\ X(d\;U\;c)\) | “Both of the above must be true at the moment the formula is checked.” |

### Refined natural‑language phrase

> **At the present state**  
>  • \(b\) must be true **or** \(a\) must be false.  
>   
> **And** in the **next** state, **enforced from that state onward**  
>  • \(d\) must hold continuously until some future state where \(c\) becomes true; after \(c\) occurs, no further obligation on \(d\) remains.

### Illustrative sequences

| Sequence of states (fields: \(a,b,c,d\)) | Does the formula hold? | Why? |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|------|
| 1: (false, false, \_, \_) → 2: ( \_, \_, \_, \_ )… | Yes (if \(X(dU c)\) is satisfied) | Left side: \(\neg a\) is true. Right side: next state must satisfy “\(d\;U\;c\)”. |
| 1: (true, false, \_, \_) → 2: … | No | Left side fails: \(b\) false and \(a\) true → both disjuncts false. |
| 1: (false, true, \_, \_) → 2: ( \_, \_, \_, true) → 3: ( \_, \_, true, \_) | Yes | Left side true (b true). Right side: from state 2, \(d\) stays true until state 3 where \(c\) becomes true. |
| 1: (false, true, \_, \_) → 2: ( \_, \_, \_, false ) (and no \(c\) ever) | No | Right side violated: \(d\) becomes false before any \(c\) occurs, so \(d U c\) fails. |

### Potential misunderstandings

* **When the constraint on \(d\) disappears**: It only ends once \(c\) becomes true *in the timeline that starts at the next state*. After that point, the formula imposes no requirement on \(d\) or on any other variable.
* **The \(X\) operator’s role**: It does **not** demand that the condition hold in the current state; it merely shifts the evaluation point one step forward. If the next state lacks a future \(c\), the whole formula fails, even though the current state may satisfy \((b|\neg a)\).
* **Local vs. future constraints**: \((b|\neg a)\) is a purely local (current‑state) obligation, whereas \(X(d U c)\) is a future obligation that may persist for many steps until \(c\) occurs.

This concise, bottom‑up explanation captures exactly when the formula applies, how it is evaluated over time, and in what scenarios it holds or is violated.
