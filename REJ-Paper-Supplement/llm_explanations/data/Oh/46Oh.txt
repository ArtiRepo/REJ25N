**Original LTL formula**  
```
F d | G !n
```

### Bottom‑up reconstruction  

1. **`F d`** – “there exists a future state in which `d` is true”.  
2. **`G !n`** – “for every state of the execution, `n` is false”.  
3. **`|`** (disjunction) – “the overall formula is true if at least one of its operands is true”.

### Refined natural‑language description  

> The system satisfies the formula whenever **either**  
> * `d` becomes true at least once in the future, **or**  
> * `n` remains false in every state of the run.  

- At the moment the formula is evaluated (any state), the “`G !n`” part already imposes an ongoing constraint: `n` must stay false forever.  
- The “`F d`” part imposes a one‑shot constraint that is satisfied as soon as a future state with `d` = true is reached; after that, the constraint on `d` disappears, but the formula may still be false if `G !n` is also false.  
- If `F d` is satisfied **before** the first violation of `G !n`, the overall disjunction is already true, so later occurrences of `n` becoming true no longer render the formula false.  
- If `d` never becomes true, then the truth of the formula depends entirely on `G !n`; any state where `n` is true will make `G !n` false, and thus the whole formula false.  

**Summary:**  
The formula demands that the execution contain at least one occurrence of `d`, or that `n` never be true at all. Once `d` occurs, the requirement on `n` becomes irrelevant; but if `d` never occurs, `n` must stay false forever for the formula to hold.
