**Original LTL formula**  
\[
a \;|\; b \;|\; !c
\]

### Bottom‑up rebuilding of the tree  
1. **Leaves** – atomic propositions:  
   - \(a\)  
   - \(b\)  
   - \(c\)  
2. **Negation** – \(!c\) (c must be false).  
3. **Disjunction** – first combine \(a\) and \(b\): \(a \;|\; b\).  
4. **Disjunction** – combine the result with \(!c\): \((a \;|\; b) \;|\; !c\).  

This is the full parse tree; there are no temporal operators.

### Refined natural‑language phrasing  
"**In the current state, at least one of the following must hold: a, b, or not c**."

*Because there are no temporal operators*, the formula is checked only in the state where it is evaluated.  
- **Satisfied**: if \(a\) is true, or \(b\) is true, or \(c\) is false.  
- **Violated**: if \(a\) is false, \(b\) is false, and \(c\) is true—all three disjuncts fail.  

No future or past constraints are imposed; once the formula is evaluated, no ongoing restrictions remain.
