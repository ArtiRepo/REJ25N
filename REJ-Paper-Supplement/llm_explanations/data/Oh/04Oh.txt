**Original LTL formula**  
\( b \; |\; !X\,a \)

**Bottom‑up build‑up**

1. **\(a\)** – “\(a\) is true in the current state.”  
2. **\(X\,a\)** – “\(a\) must be true in the very next state.”  
3. **\(!X\,a\)** – “It is *not* the case that \(a\) is true in the next state.”  
4. **\(b\)** – “\(b\) is true in the current state.”  
5. **\(b|\!X\,a\)** – “\(b\) is true in the current state **or** it is not the case that \(a\) will be true in the next state.”

**Refined natural‑language meaning**

- **Immediate constraint**:  
  At the present step, the system must satisfy one of two possibilities:  
  1. **\(b\) holds now** – then the formula is satisfied regardless of everything else.  
  2. **\(b\) does not hold now** – then the system must ensure that **\(a\) will not be true** in the very next step.  

- **When the constraint applies**:  
  Only in the second branch, if \(b\) is false. In that case the future state is limited to a single variable: \(a\) must be false.  

- **When the constraint disappears**:  
  After the next state is reached, the formula’s truth value is already determined; no further restriction on either \(b\) or \(a\) (or other variables) is imposed by this formula.  

- **Satisfying sequences**:  
  *Current state*: \(b = \text{true}, a = \text{any}\) → formula holds immediately.  
  *Current state*: \(b = \text{false}\) and *next state*: \(a = \text{false}\) → formula holds.  

- **Violating sequences**:  
  *Current state*: \(b = \text{false}\) **and** *next state*: \(a = \text{true}\) → the formula is false at the current state.  

**Key take‑away**  
The formula enforces either an immediate truth of \(b\) or, if \(b\) is absent now, a single‑step prohibition that \(a\) becomes true next. Once evaluated, it imposes no ongoing constraints beyond that one future state.
