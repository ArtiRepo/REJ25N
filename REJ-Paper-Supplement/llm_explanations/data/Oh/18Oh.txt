**Original LTL formula**  
`!F (a & b)`

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up**  
- `a & b`: the conjunction is true in a state exactly when both `a` and `b` are true.  
- `F (a & b)`: “there exists a state in the current or any future execution step where `a` and `b` are simultaneously true.”  
- `!F (a & b)`: “the previous proposition is false, i.e., no such state exists from the current point onward.”

**Refined natural‑language phrasing**  
“**`a` and `b` are never true at the same time in this execution** – not even in the current state, and not in any future state.”  

*Key points to remember*  
1. **Constraint imposed**: The formula forces a perpetual restriction that prohibits any state where both `a` and `b` hold together.  
2. **When the constraint stops applying**: It never stops; once `a & b` occurs, the formula has already been violated and will remain false for all subsequent checks.  
3. **Satisfying sequence example**: `a=true,b=false` → `a=false,b=true` → `a=true,b=false` … (never both true). The formula holds from the start.  
4. **Violating sequence example**: `a=true,b=true` at the initial state (or at any future state) immediately falsifies the formula.  

**Common misunderstandings**  
- Thinking the formula allows a single occurrence of `a & b` somewhere later (wrong; it forbids any occurrence).  
- Confusing the negation of `F` with a negation of the immediate state (note: `!F` refers to the entire future, including the current state).  

The formula thus establishes an invariant that `a` and `b` are mutually exclusive throughout the entire ongoing execution.
