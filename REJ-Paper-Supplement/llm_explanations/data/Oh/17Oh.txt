**Original LTL formula**  
\[
!G\,c
\]

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up**  

1. \(G\,c\) means *“c is true in every state of the execution.”*  
2. The leading “!” is a negation, so \( !G\,c \) means *“it is not the case that c is true in every state.”*  
3. By the guidelines, this is equivalent to: *“There must be at least one state where c is false.”*

**Refined natural‑language phrasing**  

The system must **eventually violate** property c: at some point in the execution, c must be false.  
If c is already false in the current state, the formula is immediately satisfied.  
If c holds now, the formula still requires that a future state exists where c becomes false.  
Once that first false occurrence of c occurs, the formula is satisfied and no further temporal constraint remains.  

*Violation scenario*: If c stays true in every state (never becomes false), the formula \(!G\,c\) is not satisfied.  
*Potential misunderstanding*: \(!G\,c\) does **not** forbid c from ever being true; it only forbids c from being true forever.
