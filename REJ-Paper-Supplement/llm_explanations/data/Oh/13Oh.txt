**Original LTL formula**  
\[
(c \;U\; a)\ \wedge\ (b \;U\; a)
\]

### Building the meaning (bottom‑up)

1. **\(c \;U\; a\)**  
   * \(a\) must become true at some future state.  
   * Until that future state, every state satisfies \(c\).

2. **\(b \;U\; a\)**  
   * \(a\) must become true at some future state.  
   * Until that same future state, every state satisfies \(b\).

3. **\((c \;U\; a)\ \wedge\ (b \;U\; a)\)**  
   * Both until–conditions must hold simultaneously.  
   * Therefore, a single future state must contain \(a\), and every state **before** that state must satisfy **both** \(c\) and \(b\).

### Refined natural‑language description

*“There must be a future state where \(a\) holds, and **every** state leading up to that first \(a\) must satisfy both \(c\) and \(b\).  
After \(a\) becomes true, no further constraints are imposed on \(c\) or \(b\).  
If no such future \(a\) exists, or if any preceding state violates either \(c\) or \(b\), the formula is violated.”*
