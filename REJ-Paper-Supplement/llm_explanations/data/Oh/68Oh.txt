**Original LTL formula**  
```
a U b
```

**Bottom‑up reconstruction**  
*Atomic level* – In each state the truth values of the propositions `a` and `b` are observed.  
*U level* – The until operator demands two things:  
1. There **must exist** a future state in which `b` is true.  
2. **In every state up to (but not including) that state** the proposition `a` must be true.  

Thus `a U b` is true in a run iff a is continuously true until the first occurrence of `b`; once `b` occurs the requirement on `a` ceases.

**Refined natural language phrasing**  
“`b` must eventually become true, and while waiting for that to happen `a` has to stay true in every state.  
If `b` appears immediately, the formula is satisfied right away and imposes no further constraints on `a`.  
If `a` becomes false at any point before the first `b`, or if `b` never occurs, the formula is violated.”

**Illustration**

| State | a | b | a U b (current truth) | Constraint on a |
|-------|---|---|----------------------|-----------------|
| 0     | T | F | ? (look ahead)       | a must be true  |
| 1     | T | F | ?                    | a must be true  |
| 2     | T | T |  **true**            | no more needed  |
| 3     | X | X | same as state 2      | ...             |

*Violation sample*:  
State 0: a = T, b = F → ok;  
State 1: a = F, b = F → `a` fails before a `b`; formula false.

*Early satisfaction*:  
State 0: a = T, b = T → `b` holds immediately; formula true, and `a` is no longer constrained.  

This captures when the formula imposes constraints (`a` must stay true) and when those constraints stop (after the first `b`).
