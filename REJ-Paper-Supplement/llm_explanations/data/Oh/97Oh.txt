**Original LTL formula**  
`!s U g`

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up**  
- **!s** = “s is false in the current state.”  
- **U** = “until.”  
- **g** = “g is true in some future state.”

Putting them together: the sub‑formula `!s` has to hold in every state **up to** the first state where `g` becomes true; once `g` occurs, the requirement on `!s` ends.

**Refined natural‑language phrasing**  
“*The proposition g must eventually become true, and until that moment the proposition s must remain false. After g becomes true, there are no further constraints on s.*”

**When does the formula impose a constraint?**  
- From the start of the execution until the first occurrence of g, every state must satisfy ¬s.  
- The constraint ceases once g is true.

**When does the formula get violated?**  
- If g never occurs, the formula is violated (because the “until” never resolves).  
- If s becomes true at any state before the first g, the formula is violated immediately at that state.  

**When is the formula satisfied?**  
- When there is a future state where g holds, and all intermediate states have s false. The formula is then true starting from the current state and remains true thereafter, with no ongoing requirement on s.
