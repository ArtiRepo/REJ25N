**Original LTL formula**

`b & X (a U c)`

---

### Bottom‑up reconstruction of meaning  

1. **`a U c`** – “`c` must eventually become true, and until that moment **each** state must satisfy `a`.”  
   *Once `c` appears, the obligation on `a` stops.*

2. **`X (a U c)`** – “In the very next state, the sub‑formula `a U c` must hold.”  
   *Thus, constraints on `a` and `c` only start applying from the next state onward.*

3. **`b & X (a U c)`** – “`b` must be true in the current state, **and** the next state must satisfy `a U c`.”  
   *Both parts are required simultaneously.*

### Refined natural‑language phrasing

> **“The current state must satisfy `b`.  
> In the next state, `a` must hold in every state until some future state where `c` becomes true; after `c` appears no further requirement on `a` remains.”**

### How the formula is evaluated and when constraints apply

| Time | What is evaluated | Constraint in force |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **0** (current) | `b` | `b` must hold now. |
| **1** | `a U c` starts | `a` must hold in state 1, 2, … until a state with `c`. The requirement on `a` ends at the first `c`. |
| Subsequent | `c` may or may not still hold | Once `c` has occurred, no further obligations on `a` (or `c`) are imposed.|

- **Immediate satisfaction**: The formula is considered satisfied at a point if all required conditions hold from that point forward (viewed as an infinite trace).  
- **Ongoing constraints**: Until `c` appears in the future, the system must keep `a` true; after `c`, that particular constraint disappears.

### Example sequences  

| Sequence | Evaluation | Formula holds? |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| `t0: b` ; `t1: a`; `t2: a`; `t3: c` | `b` true at `t0`. `a` continually true until `c` at `t3`. | **Yes** – all conditions satisfied. |
| `t0: ¬b` ; `t1: a`; `t2: c` | `b` fails at current state. | **No** – fails immediately. |
| `t0: b` ; `t1: ¬a`; `t2: c` | `a` fails before the first `c`. | **No** – violates the `a U c` part. |
| `t0: b` ; `t1: a`; `t2: a`; `t3: a` … forever | `c` never occurs. | **No** – `F(c)` part of `a U c` never satisfied. |

### Common misunderstandings highlighted

* The conjunction does **not** mean “`b` must hold forever.” Only the next‑state part involves a temporal constraint; after the next state, `b` is no longer enforced.
* The requirement on `a` only matters **up to** the first occurrence of `c`. After that, `a` may be true or false without affecting the formula.
* If `c` never appears, the formula is unsatisfied regardless of how `a` behaves after the next state.
