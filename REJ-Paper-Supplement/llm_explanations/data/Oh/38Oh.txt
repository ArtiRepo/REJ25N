**Original LTL Formula**  
\[
(a \; U \; b)\; \land\; (c \; U \; d)
\]

### 1. Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  

**a U b**  
- “b must eventually become true.”  
- “Until that moment, a must be true in every state.”  
- After b first holds, a need not hold any more.

**c U d**  
- “d must eventually become true.”  
- “Until that moment, c must be true in every state.”  
- After d first holds, c need not hold any more.

**(a U b) ∧ (c U d)**  
- Both until‑constraints must be satisfied **simultaneously**.  
- The formula is true in a run iff  
  1. There is a state where b first holds, and a is true in all earlier states.  
  2. There is a (possibly different) state where d first holds, and c is true in all earlier states.  
- The two untils are independent; satisfying one does not replace the need to satisfy the other.

### 2. Refined natural‑language phrasing  

> **“Both of the following conditions must hold in the system execution:**  
> 1. There must be a future point where **b** becomes true, and **a** must be true at every point before that. Once **b** holds, **a** is no longer required.  
> 2. There must be a future point where **d** becomes true, and **c** must be true at every point before that. Once **d** holds, **c** is no longer required.”**

This phrasing makes clear:  
- **Constraints apply only up to the first occurrence of b (or d)**.  
- **After b (or d) is satisfied, the constraint on a (or c) disappears**.  
- **Both sets of constraints must be met in the same execution**, but the moments for b and d can be at different times.  

### Examples  

| Execution | Status of (a U b) ∧ (c U d) | Explanation |
|-----------|---------------------------|-------------|
| a a b …   | Satisfied (b reached) | a holds until b (Good). |
| a a …     | Not satisfied | b never occurs → violation of a U b. |
| … c c d … | Satisfied | d reached; c held until then. |
| … c …     | Not satisfied | d never occurs → violation of c U d. |
| a a … c c d … b … | Satisfied | Both b and d eventually hold, with a and c holding up to their respective first occurrences. |
| a a … b … (but before d) | Not satisfied | d never occurs → whole formula false. |

**Potential misunderstanding**  
- Confusing “until” with “always”: a and c only need to hold **up to** b and d, not forever.  
- Believing that once both b and d hold, the whole formula immediately stays true: the formula remains true thereafter, but it was only imposed while waiting for b and d.
