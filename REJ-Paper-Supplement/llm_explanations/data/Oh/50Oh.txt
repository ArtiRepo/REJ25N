- **Original LTL formula**  
  `F (o U u)`

- **Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up**

  1. **Inner part** `o U u`  
     *`u` must eventually become true.*  
     *Until that first `u`, `o` has to be true in every state.*  
     After `u` happens, nothing else about `o` is required.

  2. **Outer part** `F (…)`  
     *There must be at least one future state where the inner requirement is satisfied.*  
     So we look forward until we reach a state that satisfies the “`o` until `u`” pattern.

- **Refined natural‑language phrasing**

  “At some point in the future, we will reach a state from which the proposition `o` holds continuously until a later state where `u` becomes true; after that `u` occurs, the requirement on `o` stops. The system is allowed to have any behaviour before that point, but somewhere on the run this sequence of `o`‑then‑`u` must occur.”
