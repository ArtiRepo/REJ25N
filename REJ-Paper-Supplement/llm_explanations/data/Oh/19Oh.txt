**Original LTL formula**  
`F (!y & w)`

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up**  
1. `!y & w` – a conjunction that is true only in states where **y is false** *and* **w is true**.  
2. `F φ` – “eventually φ”: there must exist **at least one future state** (i.e., not necessarily the next state) in which φ holds.

Combining, the formula requires that at some point in the future there is a state with `!y & w`. No requirement is imposed on the present or on any intermediate states; after that state any behavior is allowed.

**Refined natural‑language phrasing**  
“There will eventually be a state in which **y is false and w is true**.”
