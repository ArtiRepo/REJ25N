**Original LTL formula**  
```
X t => u
```

### Rebuilding meaning from the bottom of the tree up  

1. **Atomic propositions**  
   - `t` – unconstrained by itself.  
   - `u` – unconstrained by itself.

2. **Next operator**  
   - `X t` means “`t` must be true in the very next state.”  
   - It places a constraint only on the *future* state, not on the current one.

3. **Implication**  
   - `X t => u` is evaluated in the **current** state.  
   - Its truth value depends on:  
        *If `X t` is true (i.e., `t` will hold next) then `u` must be true now.*  
   - If `X t` is false, the implication is automatically true, so no requirement on `u`.

### Refined natural‑language phrasing

“**If** `t` will be true in the next state, **then** `u` must be true now.  
Otherwise, `u` is unconstrained.”

This captures that the formula imposes a constraint on the current variable `u` **only** when a future state requirement (`t` in the next state) is triggered. If `t` does not hold in the next state, the implication holds vacuously, and no obligation is placed on `u`.
