### Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  

| Element | Meaning | How it is evaluated |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| \(c\) | Proposition *c* is true in the current state. | Immediate check at the current state. |
| \(b\) | Proposition *b* is true in the current state. | Immediate check at the current state. |
| \(c \land b\) | Both *c* **and** *b* are true in the current state. | Requires that both hold at each state examined so far. |
| \(a\) | Proposition *a* is true in the current state. | Immediate check at the current state. |
| \((c\land b)\;U\;a\) | *a* must eventually become true; until that very state, every state must satisfy both *c* and *b*. | Evaluated over the execution trace:  
1. Scan states forward until the first state where *a* holds.  
2. All states before that point must have *c* and *b* true.  
3. Once *a* occurs, the requirement stops – no further constraints on *c* or *b*. |

### Refined natural‑language phrasing  

> **“Eventually *a* becomes true, and until the first state where *a* is true, both *c* and *b* must be true in every state.”**  

This captures that the formula constrains the system only up to the moment that *a* holds; thereafter no obligation remains on *c* or *b*. If *a* never occurs, or if either *c* or *b* fails before *a*, the formula is violated. If *a* appears immediately (in the current state), the antecedent \(c \land b\) is vacuously satisfied, and the formula holds immediately.
