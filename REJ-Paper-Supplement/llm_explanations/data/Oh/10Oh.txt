**Original LTL formula**  
\[
(d \;|\; \neg b)\; \mathbf{U}\; \neg a
\]

**Bottom‑up reconstruction**

| Layer | Expression | Meaning |
|-------|------------|---------|
| 0 | \(d\), \(b\), \(a\) | atomic propositions |
| 1 | \(\neg b\) | “\(b\) is false” |
|   | \(\neg a\) | “\(a\) is false” |
| 2 | \(d \;|\; \neg b\) | “\(d\) is true **or** \(b\) is false” |
| 3 | \((d \;|\; \neg b)\; \mathbf{U}\; \neg a\) | “The proposition \(d \;|\; \neg b\) must hold at every state *until* the first state where \(\neg a\) (i.e., \(a\) is false) becomes true. Once \(\neg a\) occurs, no further constraints are imposed.”

**Refined natural‑language phrasing**

> **Until the first time \(a\) becomes false, the system must always satisfy “\(d\) is true or \(b\) is false”.**  
> Once \(a\) is false, the formula is satisfied and the earlier requirement no longer applies.

**Evaluating the formula**

- **Checking at a state**: Look ahead to the first future state where \(a\) is false.  
  - If such a state exists **and** every state before it satisfies “\(d\) or not \(b\)”, the formula is true.  
  - If before the first false‑\(a\) state a state violates “\(d\) or not \(b\)”, or if no state with \(\neg a\) ever occurs, the formula is false.

- **Immediate vs. ongoing constraints**:  
  - *Immediate*: In any current state, the formula is *not* checked; it is a future‑looking condition.  
  - *Ongoing*: While waiting for \(\neg a\) to hold, the system must continually ensure \(d \lor \neg b\).  
  - *Stop*: Once \(\neg a\) becomes true, the ongoing constraint ceases; afterwards the formula is permanently satisfied.

**Illustrative sequences**

| Sequence (states) | Evaluation | Result |
|-------------------|------------|--------|
| \(d\), \(d\), \(\neg a\) | All intermediate states satisfy \(d\) | **True** |
| \(d\), \(\neg b\), \(\neg a\) | All intermediate states satisfy \(d \lor \neg b\) | **True** |
| \(d\), \(\neg b\), \(d\) (no \(\neg a\)) | No \(\neg a\) occurs | **False** |
| \(d\), (!\(d\)), \(\neg a\) | Intermediate state violates \(d \lor \neg b\) | **False** |

**Common misunderstandings**

- Thinking the formula restricts the system *after* \(\neg a\).  
  → The constraint ends exactly at the first \(\neg a\).
- Believing the formula checks \(d \lor \neg b\) at the state where \(\neg a\) appears.  
  → That state satisfies \(\neg a\) and is exempt from the left side.
- Confusing “at least one future state” (as in \(F(p)\)) with “eventually first state” (as in \(\mathbf{U}\)).  
  → \(\mathbf{U}\) requires a *specific* first state where the right side holds.
