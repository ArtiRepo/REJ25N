**Original LTL formula**  
`XXFXa`

### 1. Rebuilding the meaning from the bottom of the tree up  

| Sub‑formula | Meaning (bottom‑up) | Natural‑language restatement |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| `a` | the atomic proposition `a` | “the proposition `a` is true in the current state.” |
| `X a` | “in the immediately next state, `a` holds.” | “`a` must be true in the next state.” |
| `F(X a)` | “there exists some future state where the next state satisfies `X a`.” | “Some point in the future must have the property that `a` will be true immediately after it.” |
| `X(F(X a))` | “in the next state the property `F(X a)` holds.” | “In one step from now, we will reach a state from which some future point has `a` true in the next state.” |
| `X(X(F(X a)))` | “in the next state the property `X(F(X a))` holds.” | “Two steps from now, we must be in a state from which a future point exists where `a` is true in its following state.” |

---

### 2. Refined natural‑language phrasing  

**“Two steps from the present moment, the system must reach a state from which some later state exists such that `a` holds in the state immediately after that later one.”**

Key points about when the formula imposes constraints:

| Timeline | Constraint | Holds? |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Current state | None – the formula does not look at the present. | • |
| State + 1 | **None** – the next state is only a passing point. | • |
| State + 2 | **Must exist** a future state that has `a` true right after it. | Satisfying if such a future `a` exists; violating if no such future state can be found. |
| After State + 2 | Once the specified future state is reached, the formula is fulfilled and imposes no further constraints. | The formula remains true thereafter. |

### 3. Illustrative sequences  

* **Satisfying**:  
  - State0: `a` false.  
  - State1: `a` false.  
  - State2: `a` true (satisfies the “next state” part of the future point).  
  → `XXFXa` holds because from state + 2 we find a state where `a` is true in the next state.

* **Violating**:  
  - State0: `a` false.  
  - State1: `a` false.  
  - State2: `a` false.  
  - All subsequent states: `a` false.  
  → No future state with `a` true in the next state, so `F(X a)` fails at state + 2, making the whole formula false.

**Bottom line**: The formula only starts to constrain the system two steps in the future and only requires that some later point has `a` in the following state. Once that point is reached, the requirement is satisfied and no further constraint remains.
