**Original LTL formula**  
`t => w`

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up**  
- The leaves are the atomic propositions `t` and `w`.  
- These are combined by the implication operator `=>`.  
- No temporal operator (X, G, F, U, etc.) wraps the implication, so its scope is just the current state.

**Refined natural‑language phrasing**  
“**In the state where the formula is checked, if `t` holds, then `w` must also hold. If `t` is false, the implication is automatically satisfied regardless of `w`.**”

- The formula is evaluated only at the present state; it imposes no constraints on future states.  
- It holds in a sequence when the initial state satisfies the implication (either `t` is false or both `t` and `w` are true).  
- It is violated when `t` is true but `w` is false in that same state.  
- To enforce the pattern over all states, one would write `G(t => w)`.
