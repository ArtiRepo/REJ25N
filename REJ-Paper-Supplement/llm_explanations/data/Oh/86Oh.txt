**Original LTL formula**  
`t`

**Bottom‑up reconstruction**

| LTL fragment | Meaning | Constraint applied | Time domain |
|--------------|---------|--------------------|-------------|
| `t` (atomic) | `t` must be true in the current state | Yes, only the present state | Present only |

There are no temporal operators (`X`, `G`, `F`, `U`, etc.). Thus the formula does **not** impose any requirement on future or past states; it only asserts a property of the current state.

**Refined natural‑language phrasing**

- *“The proposition `t` must hold in the current state.”*  
  This is the only constraint the formula places on the system. If `t` is false now, the entire formula evaluates to false. There are no ongoing constraints thereafter; once the current state has been evaluated, the formula’s truth value is fixed for the current execution.  

- *Potential misunderstanding*: Since the formula lacks temporal operators, readers might mistakenly think `t` is required forever (`G t`). In fact, only the present instant is relevant.
