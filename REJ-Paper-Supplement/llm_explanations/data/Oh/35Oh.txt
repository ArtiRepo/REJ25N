**Original LTL formula**  
`F (f => j)`

---

### Bottom‑up reconstruction  

1. **Innermost subformula**: `f => j`  
   *In any particular state it is true iff either `f` is false or `j` is true.*  
   The implication is violated only when `f` holds and `j` does not.

2. **Outer operator**: `F ϕ` where `ϕ` is `f => j`  
   *“Eventually (at some future state) the subformula ϕ must be true.”*  
   We look along the execution for the first state that satisfies `f => j`.

---

### Refined natural‑language phrasing  

**“There is at least one state that the system will reach in the future (possibly the current state) where, if `f` holds, then `j` also holds; otherwise `f` is not true at that point.”**

---

### Constraints and their lifetimes  

* The formula imposes **no constraint** until we encounter the first state that satisfies `f => j`.  
* Up to and including that state, the execution may freely have `f` true and `j` false; the formula is not yet satisfied.  
* The moment we reach a state where `f` is false **or** where `f` is true and `j` is true, the formula becomes true.  
  From that point onward the formula remains satisfied regardless of what happens next.

### Satisfying sequences  

| State | f | j | f ⇒ j | How formula is satisfied |
|-------|---|---|--------|--------------------------|
| 0 (now) | false | *any* | true | `F` satisfied immediately |
| 0 | true | true | true | `F` satisfied immediately |
| 0 | true | false | false | `F` not yet satisfied; look ahead |
| 1 | true | false | false | still not satisfied |
| 2 | false | *any* | true | `F` satisfied at state 2; subsequent states irrelevant |

### Violating sequence  

All states have `f` true and `j` false.  
Then every instance of `f ⇒ j` is false, so no state ever satisfies the inner implication, and `F(f ⇒ j)` remains false forever.

---

**Key takeaway** – `F (f => j)` only demands that at some point in the future the implication holds; it does **not** enforce that `f` implies `j` from the present onward. The constraint disappears as soon as the first satisfying state is reached.
