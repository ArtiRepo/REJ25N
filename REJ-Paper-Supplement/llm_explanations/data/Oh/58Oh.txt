- **Original LTL formula**  
  \[
  !F(a \land Xa \land XXa)
  \]

- **Bottom‑up reconstruction**  

  1. **\(a\)** – the atomic claim “\(a\) is true in the current state.”
  2. **\(Xa\)** – “\(a\) is true in the very next state.”
  3. **\(XXa\)** – “\(a\) is true in the state two steps after the current one.”
  4. **\(a \land Xa \land XXa\)** – “\(a\) holds now, the next state is also \(a\), and the following state is again \(a\).”  
     In other words, three consecutive states satisfy \(a\).
  5. **\(F(a \land Xa \land XXa)\)** – “Eventually there will be a point in the trace where this three‑in‑a‑row pattern occurs.”
  6. **\(!F(a \land Xa \land XXa)\)** – “It is not true that such a point ever occurs.”  
     Equivalently: “For **every** point in the execution, the pattern of three consecutive \(a\)’s does **not** start there.”

- **Refined natural‑language phrasing**  

  *The formula states that no matter where we are on the timeline, we must never see \(a\) hold for three consecutive states. In every state of the run, it must not be the case that \(a\) is true in that state, the next state, and the state after that. Thus any sequence that contains a run of three consecutive \(a\)’s violates the formula, while all sequences that never exhibit such a pattern satisfy it.*
