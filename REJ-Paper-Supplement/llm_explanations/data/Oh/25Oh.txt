- **Original LTL formula**  
  `!X t`

- **Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up**  
  1. **Bottom:** `t` – the atomic proposition `t` is evaluated in a state.  
  2. `X t` – “`t` must be true **in the very next state**.”  
  3. `!X t` – “It is **not** the case that `t` is true in the next state.”  
     Therefore the formula demands that `t` be false **in the next state**.

- **Refined natural‑language phrasing**  
  **"t is false in the next state."**  
  This statement imposes a one‑step constraint: at the current state, the system must ensure that the proposition `t` will not be true in the following state. The constraint applies only to that immediate next state; if `t` is false there, the formula is satisfied and no further obligation regarding `t` follows. If `t` becomes true in the next state, the formula is violated. The current state itself is unconstrained by this formula.
