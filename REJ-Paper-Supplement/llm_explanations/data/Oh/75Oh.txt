**Original LTL formula**  
\( F(\,a \land b\,)\)

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up**  

1. \(a \land b\) – a state in which *both* propositions are true.  
2. \(F(\,a \land b\,)\) – “there exists at least one future state where  
   \(a \land b\) holds”.

**Refined natural‑language phrasing**  

*“At some point in the future, both a and b become true at the same time.”*

- **Constraint imposition**  
  - The formula imposes **no constraint** on a or b in the present or until that future point.  
  - Once a state is reached where both a and b are true, the formula evaluates to true and no longer restricts the system.  

- **Evaluation over time**  
  - At the moment the formula is checked it is *false* if no such future state has yet been seen.  
  - It turns *true* exactly when a state with \(a \land b\) is encountered.  
  - After that moment it remains true perpetually.  

- **Satisfying sequence**  
  ```text
  t0: a = false, b = true
  t1: a = true,  b = false
  t2: a = true,  b = true   ← both hold → formula true
  ```

- **Violating sequence**  
  ```text
  t0: a = false, b = true
  t1: a = true,  b = false
  t2: a = false, b = false
  ...
  (never a & b) → formula false forever
  ```

- **Common misunderstandings**  
  - Thinking the formula requires a and b to be true from the start.  
  - Interpreting it as “a and b will hold in every future state.”  
  In reality, only one future occurrence is needed; after that, no ongoing constraints exist.
