**Original LTL formula**  
`G a`

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up**

1. **Atomic proposition** `a`  
   - Meaning: “\(a\) is true in the current state.”  

2. **Globally operator** `G` applied to `a`  
   - `G a` means “\(a\) must be true in every state of the execution.”  
   - The constraint persists forever; there is no later point where the requirement disappears.

**Refined natural‑language phrasing**

“\(a\) must hold at every instant of the run.  
When checked in the current state, if \(a\) is false the formula fails immediately;  
if \(a\) is true, the condition continues to hold for all future states.  
The requirement never relaxes—if \(a\) ever becomes false, the entire formula is violated for the rest of the execution.”
