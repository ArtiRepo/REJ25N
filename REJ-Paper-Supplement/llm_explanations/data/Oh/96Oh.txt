**Original LTL formula**  
`G(XXa => !a)`

---

### Bottom‑up reasoning

1. **`a`** – a proposition that may be true or false in a given state.  
2. **`!a`** – "a is false in the current state."  
3. **`XXa`** – "a will be true **exactly two steps in the future** from the current state."  
4. **`XXa => !a`** – an implication:  
   *if in two steps a will be true, then a must be false now*.  
   The implication is only a constraint on the *current* state; it does not mention the future states other than the antecedent.  
5. **`G(XXa => !a)`** – the whole implication must hold in *every* state along the execution.

### Refined natural‑language phrasing

> **"At every point in the system, if the proposition **a** is going to be true two steps ahead, then it must be false at the current point.**  
>  
> In other words, no state may have the property **a** true while also having **a** become true two steps later.  
>  
> The formula imposes a constraint only on the present state whenever the future condition is met; otherwise it is vacuously satisfied and no restriction is imposed.**
