**Original LTL formula**  
```
X (y ⇒ (x ∧ w))
```

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up**

1. **Atomic propositions**  
   - `y` – proposition that may be true or false in any state.  
   - `x` – proposition that may be true or false.  
   - `w` – proposition that may be true or false.

2. **Conjunction**  
   - `x ∧ w` is true only when **both** `x` and `w` are true in the same state.

3. **Implication**  
   - `y ⇒ (x ∧ w)` is false only when `y` is true **and** `x ∧ w` is false.  
   - It is vacuously true when `y` is false, regardless of `x` or `w`.

4. **Next operator**  
   - `X (…)` forces the sub‑formula to be true in the **very next state** (state *t+1* when the formula is checked at state *t*).  
   - No requirement is imposed on the current state (state *t*) or on states beyond *t+1*.

**Refined natural‑language phrasing**

- “In the very next state, if **y** holds, then **both x and w** must hold as well.”  
- The formula does **not** constrain the current state; it only checks the next state.  
- The constraint applies **only** to that immediately following state; there is no ongoing requirement on later states.  
- If the next state satisfies the implication (y false, or y true with x and w true), the formula is satisfied at the current point.  
- If the next state violates the implication (y true but either x or w false), the formula is violated at the current point and the execution is rejected with respect to this formula.  
- The truth value is evaluated only at the moment it is checked; once the next state has been examined, the constraint no longer applies.
