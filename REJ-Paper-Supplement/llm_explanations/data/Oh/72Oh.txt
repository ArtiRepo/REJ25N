- **Original LTL formula**  
  `G !a`

- **Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up**  
  1. Bottom node: `!a` – “`a` must be false in the current state.”  
  2. Top node: `G ( … )` – “… must hold in **every** state of the execution.”  
  3. Combined: In each state, `a` is false; this must hold for all time.

- **Refined natural‑language phrasing**  
  “The property `G !a` states that the proposition `a` is never true – at every state of the system, `a` must be false. If `a` becomes true in any state, the property is violated, and the constraint never relaxes.”
