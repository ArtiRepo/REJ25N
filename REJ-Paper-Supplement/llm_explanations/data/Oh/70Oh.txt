**Original LTL formula**  
`G(a -> b)`

---

### Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  

1. **Leaf nodes**  
   - `a` – a property that can be true or false in a state.  
   - `b` – another property that can be true or false in a state.

2. **Parent node** – implication  
   - `a -> b` is logically equivalent to `(!a) or b`.  
   - In a state the formula is satisfied if **either** `a` is false **or** `b` is true (or both).

3. **Top node** – global operator  
   - `G(a -> b)` means: *in every state of the execution, the sub‑formula `a -> b` must hold*.

### Refined natural‑language phrasing

> **In every state, if `a` holds then `b` must also hold in that same state.**  
> The formula places a constraint only on those states where `a` is true; in all other states the formula is automatically satisfied regardless of `b`.  
> • **Satisfying execution:** any trace in which no state has both `a` true and `b` false.  
> • **Violating execution:** a trace containing at least one state where `a` is true while `b` is false.  
> The constraint does not carry over beyond the specific state where `a` occurs.  
> A common misunderstanding is to think that `b` must stay true forever after `a`; the formula actually requires `b` only in the same state where `a` is true.
