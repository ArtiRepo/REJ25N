**Original LTL formula**  
\[
(b\;U\;c)\ \wedge\ (d\;U\;\neg b)
\]

### Bottom‑up breakdown

| Tree level | Expression | Meaning |
|------------|------------|---------|
| **Leaves** | \(b\), \(c\), \(d\), \(\neg b\) | Boolean propositions (or a negated proposition). |
| **First U** | \(b\;U\;c\) | “\(c\) must eventually become true, and **until that exact moment**, \(b\) must be true in every state.” After \(c\) holds, no further requirement on \(b\). |
| **Second U** | \(d\;U\;\neg b\) | “\(\neg b\) (i.e., “\(b\) is false”) must eventually become true, and **until that exact moment**, \(d\) must hold in every state.” After \(\neg b\) holds, no further requirement on \(d\). |
| **Conjunction** | \((b\;U\;c)\ \wedge\ (d\;U\;\neg b)\) | Both of the above conditions must be satisfied **simultaneously** along the same execution trace. |

### Natural‑language phrasing

- **Before \(c\) ever appears,** \(b\) must stay true in every state.  
- **Once \(c\) finally occurs,** the requirement on \(b\) is lifted (the first part of the formula becomes satisfied).

- **Before \(b\) ever becomes false,** \(d\) must remain true in every state.  
- **When \(b\) turns false for the first time,** the requirement on \(d\) ends (the second part of the formula becomes satisfied).

For the whole formula to hold, **both** of these “until” behaviours must occur somewhere in the future of the same execution:

* There must be a point where \(c\) is true, and until that point, \(b\) has been true at every step.  
* There must also be a (possibly different) point where \(b\) becomes false, and until that point, \(d\) has been true at every step.

After each of those first points—after \(c\) has occurred and after \(b\) has become false—the corresponding constraints cease; the formula then remains true as long as the other until‑condition still reaches its eventual target.

### Clarifying remarks

* The two until‑conditions are evaluated **in parallel**; they impose constraints on different variables until their own targets _,not_ on the same variable at the same instant.  
* An execution that satisfies the formula can have \(c\) and the moment when \(b\) turns false occurring in any order (including simultaneously).  
* If either \(c\) never appears *or* \(b\) never becomes false, the corresponding until part is violated, and the conjunction fails.  
* The formula does **not** require that \(b\) stays true forever or that \(b\) remains false forever; those properties are only needed **up to** the eventual occurrence of the specified target propositions.
