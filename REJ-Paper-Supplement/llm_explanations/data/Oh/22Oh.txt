**Original LTL formula**  
`!X !(w | x)`

---

### Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  

| Step | Sub‑formula | Interpretation |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | `w | x` | “w or x” |
| 2 | `!(w | x)` | “neither w nor x” (both are false) |
| 3 | `X !(w | x)` | “in the very next state, neither w nor x holds” |
| 4 | `!X !(w | x)` | “it is *not* the case that in the next state neither w nor x holds” |

Equivalent rewrite: `!X ¬(w|x) ≡ X (w|x)` → “in the next state, `w` **or** `x` must be true.”

### Refined natural‑language phrasing  

> **The next state must contain at least one of the propositions `w` or `x`.**  
>  
>  * When this formula is checked in a current state, it looks at the immediate next state.  
>  * If that next state has either `w` true or `x` true, the formula is satisfied and no further constraints arise.  
>  * If both `w` and `x` are false in that next state, the formula is violated.  
>  * The constraint applies only to that one time step; after the next state the formula imposes nothing else.  

**Illustrative sequences**

| Current | Next | `!X !(w|x)` | Verdict |
|---------|------|-------------|---------|
| any | `w` true, `x` false | ✅ | Satisfied |
| any | `w` false, `x` true | ✅ | Satisfied |
| any | `w` false, `x` false | ❌ | Violated |

Potential misunderstanding: thinking the condition applies to all future states or beyond the next step. In fact it restricts only the immediate successor; once the next state is examined, the formula no longer imposes any requirement.
