**Original LTL formula**  
`G(a ∧ ¬b)`

**Rebuil­ding meaning from the bottom of the tree up**  

1. **Leaf propositions**  
   - `a` – requires `a` to be true *in the current state*.  
   - `¬b` – requires `b` to be false *in the current state*.  

2. **Conjunction**  
   - `a ∧ ¬b` – both conditions must hold in the same state: `a` is true **and** `b` is false.

3. **Global operator** (`G`)  
   - `G(φ)` means “φ must hold in **every** state of the execution, forever.”  
   - Therefore `G(a ∧ ¬b)` insists that from the very first state onward, in **every** successive state, `a` stays true and `b` stays false.

**Refined natural‑language phrasing**  

"From now on and at every future step, the variable `a` must always be true, and the variable `b` must always remain false. If at any state `a` becomes false or `b` becomes true, the formula is violated and the constraint stops holding."
