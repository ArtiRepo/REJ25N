- Original LTL formula: (c U a) & (b U a)  
- Rebuild meaning:  
  - (c U a) requires that *a eventually becomes true*, and *c is true in every state before a is true*.  
  - (b U a) requires that *a eventually becomes true*, and *b is true in every state before a is true*.  
  - The conjunction enforces both constraints: *a must eventually be true*, and *both b and c must hold in all states until a is true*.  
- Refine natural language phrasing:  
  "a must eventually become true, and in all states prior to that, both b and c must hold. Once a is true, the constraints on b and c no longer apply."
