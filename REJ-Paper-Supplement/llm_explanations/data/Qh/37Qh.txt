- Original LTL formula: G (!i) | F (f U i)  
- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:  
  - G (!i): "i is false in every state."  
  - f U i: "i eventually becomes true, and f is true in all states until then."  
  - F (f U i): "There exists a future state where i becomes true, and f is true in all prior states."  
  - The formula as a whole: "Either i is never true, or there is a point where i becomes true, and f is true in all states before that point."  
- Refine natural language phrasing for clarity:  
  "The system must never have i true, or there must be a moment when i becomes true, with f being true in all states leading up to that moment."
