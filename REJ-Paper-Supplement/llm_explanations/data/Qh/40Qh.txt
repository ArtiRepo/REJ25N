- Write down original LTL formula: F (o | u)  
- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:  
  - (o | u) means "o or u is true in the current state."  
  - F (o | u) means "there exists at least one future state where (o | u) is true."  
- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:  
  "The system must ensure that at some future point, either o or u becomes true. Until then, o and u are unconstrained; once either holds in a state, the formula is satisfied and no further constraints apply."
