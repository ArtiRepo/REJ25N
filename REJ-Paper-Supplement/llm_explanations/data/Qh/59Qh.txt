- Original LTL formula: G((a ∧ Xa) → XX¬a)  
- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:  
  - (a ∧ Xa): "a is true in the current state and the next state."  
  - XX¬a: "a is false two states ahead."  
  - (a ∧ Xa) → XX¬a: "If a is true in the current and next state, then a must be false two states ahead."  
  - G((a ∧ Xa) → XX¬a): "For all states, if a is true in the current and next state, then a must be false two states ahead."  
- Refine natural language phrasing:  
  "At every state, if a holds now and will hold in the next state, then a must be false two states later."  

**Constraints**:  
- The formula imposes a constraint only when two consecutive a's occur.  
- If a is true in the current and next state, the state after that must have ¬a.  
- Otherwise, no constraints on a's future values.  

**Behavior**:  
- Satisfied if all pairs of consecutive a's are followed by a state where a is false.  
- Violated if any two consecutive a's are not followed by a false a two steps later.
