- Write down original LTL formula  
G(a ∨ b)  

- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
G requires the enclosed proposition to hold in *every state* of the execution. Here, the proposition is (a ∨ b), meaning "a is true, or b is true, or both." Thus, the formula enforces that in *all states*, at least one of a or b must be true.  

- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity  
"a or b must be true at all times."  
This imposes a strict constraint on every state: if either a or b is false in any state, the formula is violated. The requirement persists indefinitely; there is no point where the constraint ceases. For example, a sequence where a is false but b is true in all states satisfies it, but a sequence with a state where both a and b are false violates it.
