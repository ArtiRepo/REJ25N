- Original LTL formula: XXFXa  
- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:  
  - Xa: "a must be true in the very next state."  
  - FXa: "There must exist at least one future state where Xa is true."  
  - X(FXa): "In the very next state, FXa must hold."  
  - XXFXa: "In the very next next state, FXa must hold."  
- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:  
  "Two steps from now, a must eventually be true in the following state."
