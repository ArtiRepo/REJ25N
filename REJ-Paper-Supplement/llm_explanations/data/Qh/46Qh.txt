- Write down original LTL formula  
F d | G !n  

- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
F d: "d must be true in at least one future state."  
G !n: "n is false in every state of the execution."  
The formula combines these with OR: "Either d eventually becomes true, or n is never true throughout the execution."  

- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity  
The system satisfies the formula if:  
1. **d is true at some point in the future** (no constraints on earlier states), **or**  
2. **n is false in all states** (current and future).  
Once d is true, the first condition is met, and the formula holds regardless of n. If n is false in every state, the second condition is met, and the formula holds regardless of d. The formula imposes ongoing constraints until one of the conditions is fulfilled.
