- Original LTL formula  
  (a U b) ∧ G(a)  

- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
  G(a): "a must be true in every state of the execution."  
  a U b: "b must eventually become true, and a must remain true in every state until b becomes true."  
  Combined: "a must always be true, and b must eventually become true while a is true in all preceding states."  

- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity.  
  "a is always true, and b eventually occurs, with a holding in all states until b becomes true."
