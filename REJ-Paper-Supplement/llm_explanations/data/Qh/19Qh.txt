- Write down original LTL formula  
F (!y ∧ w)  

- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
The formula asserts that at some point in the future, both "y is false" and "w is true" must hold. The "F" operator requires existence of a future state where the conjunction (!y ∧ w) is true. Until that state is reached, there are no constraints on y or w. Once the state satisfies (!y ∧ w), the formula is satisfied, and no further constraints apply.  

- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity  
"There must be a future state where y is false and w is true."
