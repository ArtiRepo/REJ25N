- Write down original LTL formula  
a U b  

- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
The formula requires that *b* eventually becomes true. Until *b* is true, *a* must hold in every state. Once *b* is true, *a* is no longer constrained.  

- Refine natural language phrasing  
"b must eventually become true, and a must remain true in all states until b is true. Once b is true, a can be either true or false in subsequent states. If b never occurs or a fails before b occurs, the formula is violated."
