- Original LTL formula: G a  
- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up: G(a) requires "a" to hold in all states of the execution. The constraint applies continuously from the initial state onward, with no relaxation even after "a" becomes true.  
- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity: "a must be true in every state throughout the entire execution. If a ever becomes false in any state, the formula is violated. The constraint is active at all times and never ceases."
