- Write down original LTL formula  
X a ∧ ¬G b  

- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
X a: "a must be true in the very next state."  
¬G b: "There must be at least one state where b is false."  
Combined: The system must satisfy both constraints simultaneously.  

- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity  
"a must be true in the next state, and b must not be true in all states—there must exist at least one state where b is false."  

Constraints:  
- X a imposes an immediate constraint on the next state; once that state is reached, the constraint is resolved.  
- ¬G b imposes a global constraint over the entire execution; it remains active until a violation (b always true) is detected.
