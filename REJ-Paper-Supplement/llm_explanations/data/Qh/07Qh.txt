- Write down original LTL formula  
  a U c  

- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
  "c must eventually become true, and throughout all preceding states, a must hold consistently. Once c is true, a is no longer required to hold."  

- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity  
  "a must remain true until c becomes true; if c never occurs, the formula is violated. Once c is true in a state, the constraint on a is lifted for subsequent states."
