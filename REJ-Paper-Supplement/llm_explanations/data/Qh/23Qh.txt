- Write down original LTL formula  
  t => w  

- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
  The formula is a logical implication. For each state in the execution, if *t* is true, then *w* must also be true in that same state. If *t* is false, the constraint on *w* does not apply. The formula imposes this condition at every state, with no temporal progression beyond the current state.  

- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity  
  "At every state, if *t* is true, then *w* must be true in that state. When *t* is false, there is no requirement on *w*."
