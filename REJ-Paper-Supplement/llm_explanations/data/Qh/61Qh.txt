- Write down original LTL formula  
  a U G!a  

- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
  The formula requires that "a is true in every state until some future state where G!a becomes true." G!a means "!a is true in all subsequent states." For a U G!a to hold, there must exist a state where G!a is true (i.e., a is false from that point onward), and all prior states must have a true. However, the state where G!a becomes true must itself have !a, conflicting with the requirement that a is true in all states up to that point. This creates an impossible constraint: a must be true at the moment G!a is satisfied, but G!a demands a is false at that moment.  

- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity  
  "a must remain true until a state where a becomes false and stays false forever; this is impossible, as the state where a becomes false must also have a true."
