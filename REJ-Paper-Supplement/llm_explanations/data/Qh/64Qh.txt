- Write down original LTL formula  
G(a → XXXa)  

- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
The formula G(p) requires p to hold in every state. Here, p is (a → XXXa). For each state, if a is true, then in the state three steps ahead (XXXa), a must also be true. If a is false in a state, the implication imposes no constraint. The constraint on a is only active when a is true, and it applies to the state three steps forward.  

- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity  
"In every state, if a is true, then a must also be true three steps later. When a is false, no constraints apply. The condition must hold continuously across all states, but only triggers when a is true, requiring a to recur exactly three steps ahead in the future."
