- Original LTL formula: t => (x & y)  
- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up: The formula states that whenever **t** is true in a state, both **x** and **y** must also be true in that same state. There are no temporal constraints beyond the immediate evaluation of propositions. If **t** is false, the formula imposes no restrictions on **x** or **y**.  
- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity: "If **t** is true, then **x** and **y** must both be true in the current state. When **t** is false, **x** and **y** can take any values."
