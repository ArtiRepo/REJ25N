- Write down original LTL formula  
  G (!f | !i)  

- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
  The formula asserts that in every state of the system's execution, at least one of "f is false" or "i is false" must hold. This means that the conjunction "f ∧ i" is never true in any state. The Global operator (G) ensures this condition is enforced continuously over time, without exception.  

- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity  
  "At all times, either f is false or i is false (or both)."  
  This requires that in every state, f and i cannot both be true simultaneously. The constraint applies at every moment and never relaxes; if either f or i is true, the other must be false. For example, a sequence where f and i are both true in any state violates the formula, while sequences where they are never both true satisfy it.
