- Write down original LTL formula  
  b U (d & a)  

- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
  The formula requires that (d ∧ a) becomes true at some future state. Until that state, b must hold in every state. Once (d ∧ a) is true, b is no longer constrained.  

- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity  
  "d and a must eventually be true, and b must remain true in all preceding states."
