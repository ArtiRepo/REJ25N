- Write down original LTL formula  
!G c  

- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
G c: "c must be true in every state of the execution."  
!G c: "It is not the case that c is true in every state," meaning "there exists at least one state where c is false."  

- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity  
"c is not always true" — the formula imposes a constraint that c must eventually be false at some point in the execution. Once a state where c is false occurs, the constraint is satisfied. If c remains true in all states, the formula is violated.
