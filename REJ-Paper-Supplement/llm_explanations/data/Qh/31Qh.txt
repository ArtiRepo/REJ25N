- Write down original LTL formula  
  d & X (c U a)  

- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
  d: "d is true in the current state."  
  c U a: "a must eventually be true, and c must hold in every state until a becomes true."  
  X (c U a): "In the next state, a must eventually be true, and c must hold in every state until a becomes true (starting from the next state)."  
  d & X (c U a): "d is true in the current state, and in the next state, a must eventually be true with c holding until a is true."  

- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity  
  "d must be true now, and starting from the next state, c must hold continuously until a becomes true at some future point."
