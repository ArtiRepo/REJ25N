- Original LTL formula: X t => X y  
- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:  
  - X t: "t must be true in the next state."  
  - X y: "y must be true in the next state."  
  - The implication X t => X y: "For all states, if the next state has t, then the next state must have y."  
- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:  
  "In every state, if the next state satisfies t, then the next state must also satisfy y."  

**Constraints**:  
- The formula imposes a constraint on the next state when t is true in it (requiring y to be true there).  
- When t is false in the next state, no constraint is applied.  
- The condition must hold at every state in the execution.  
**Evaluation**:  
- At each state, check the next state. If t is true there, y must be true in that same next state.  
- If t is never true in any next state, the formula is trivially satisfied.  
**Violations**:  
- A sequence where some state’s next state has t but lacks y violates the formula.  
**Key distinction**:  
- The constraint applies immediately to the next state (not over time) but recursively at every state in the path.
