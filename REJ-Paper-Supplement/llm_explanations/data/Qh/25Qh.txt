- Write down original LTL formula  
  !X t  

- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
  X t: "t must be true in the very next state."  
  !X t: "t must be false in the very next state."  

- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity  
  "t must be false in the next state immediately following the current one. This constraint only applies to the next state; after that, t can be true or false without affecting the formula's validity."
