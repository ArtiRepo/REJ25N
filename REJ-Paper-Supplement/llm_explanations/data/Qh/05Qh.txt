- Write down original LTL formula  
  X a & b  

- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
  X(a): "a must be true in the very next state."  
  b: "b must be true in the current state."  
  X(a) ∧ b: "In the current state, b is true; in the next state, a is true."  

- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity  
  "b must hold in the current state, and a must hold in the immediately following state."  
  Constraints apply to distinct states: b is checked at the present moment, while a is checked at the next step. Once the next state is reached, the constraint on a is satisfied, and the formula no longer imposes further requirements. A sequence violates the formula if either b is false in the current state or a is false in the next state.
