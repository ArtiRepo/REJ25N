- Write down original LTL formula  
F(a ∧ b)  

- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
F(p): "There must exist at least one future state where p is true."  
p: "a and b must both be true in that future state."  
Thus, F(a ∧ b) requires that *at some point in the future*, both a and b are simultaneously true.

- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity  
"The formula holds if there exists a future state where both a and b are true. Until that state is reached, no constraints are imposed on a or b. Once such a state occurs, the formula is satisfied, and no further conditions apply."
