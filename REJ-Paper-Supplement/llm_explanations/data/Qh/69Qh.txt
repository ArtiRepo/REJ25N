- Write down original LTL formula  
FGa  

- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
Ga: "a must be true in every state of the execution."  
F(Ga): "There must exist at least one future state where Ga is true."  
Combining: "There exists a point in time where a becomes true and remains true in all subsequent states."  

- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity  
"a must eventually become true and remain true forever after."  

**Constraints**:  
- Initially, no constraints on a.  
- Once a becomes true at some state, it must hold in all future states.  
- If a is false at all states, or if a becomes true but later turns false, the formula is violated.
