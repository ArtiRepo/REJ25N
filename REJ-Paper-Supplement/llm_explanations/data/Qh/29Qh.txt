- Write down original LTL formula  
F x | F y  

- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
F x: "x must be true in at least one future state."  
F y: "y must be true in at least one future state."  
The disjunction (|) combines these: "Either x must eventually be true, or y must eventually be true."  

- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity  
"The formula holds if, at some point in the future, x becomes true or y becomes true. Until one of them is true, the system must ensure that at least one of x or y eventually occurs. Once x or y is true in any state, the constraint is satisfied and no further conditions apply."
