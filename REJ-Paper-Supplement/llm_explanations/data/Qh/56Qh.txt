- Write down original LTL formula  
  (!a)U(a and XG!a)  

- Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
  The formula is a temporal "Until" (a U b), where a is !a and b is (a ∧ XG!a).  
  - (a ∧ XG!a): "a is true in the current state, and in the next state, a is always false."  
  - (!a)U(a ∧ XG!a): "For all states until (a ∧ XG!a) becomes true, !a must hold. Once (a ∧ XG!a) is true, the constraint on !a ends."  

- Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity  
  "a must remain false in all states until it becomes true, and once it is true, it must stay false in all subsequent states."
