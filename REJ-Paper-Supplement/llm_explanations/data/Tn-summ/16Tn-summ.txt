The formula F !b requires that there must be at least one future state where b is false. It does not impose any immediate constraints on the current state or the next state but requires that b eventually becomes false at some point in the future. Once a state is reached where b is false, the formula is satisfied, and no further constraints are imposed. The formula is violated if b remains true in all future states.
