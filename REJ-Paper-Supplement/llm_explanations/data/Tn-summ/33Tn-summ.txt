c must eventually become true, and until it does, b must be true in every state. Simultaneously, !b must eventually become true, and until it does, d must be true in every state, The constraints on b and d are lifted once c and !b become true, respectively.The formula is satisfied if both conditions are met in any order, and it is violated if either is violated before their respective conditions are satisfied.
