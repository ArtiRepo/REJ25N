In every state of the execution, if n is true, then s must also be true." The formula imposes a constraint only when n is true, requiring s to be true at the same time. This constraint applies globally, meaning it must hold in every state throughout the execution. If there is any state where n is true and s is false, the formula is violated. If n is false, there are no constraints on s for that state
