### Translation of LTL Formula: `G(a and !b)`

**Original LTL Formula:**  
`G(a and !b)`  

---

#### Breakdown (Parsing Tree):
```
     G       [Global operator: "Always"]
      |
     and     [Logical AND operator]
     /  \
    a    !    [Negation operator]
          \
           b   [Atomic proposition]
```

1. **Atomic propositions**:  
   - `a`: Proposition `a` is true.  
   - `b`: Proposition `b` is true.  

2. **Negation (`!`)**:  
   `!b` means "`b` is false."  

3. **Conjunction (`and`)**:  
   `a and !b` means "`a` is true **and** `b` is false" (both must hold simultaneously).  

4. **Global (`G`)**:  
   `G(...)` requires that "`...` holds **at every time step**, now and forever in the future."

#### Rebuilding Meaning (Bottom-Up):
- **Base**:  
  - `b` is a proposition: "`b` occurs."  
  - `!b`: "`b` does **not** occur."  
- **Combined with `and`**:  
  `a and !b`: "`a` occurs **and** `b` does **not** occur" (simultaneously).  
- **Wrapped in `G`**:  
  `G(a and !b)`: "`a` occurs and `b` does not occur **at every time step**."  

---

#### Refined Natural Language Translation:  
> **"At all times, `a` must be true and `b` must be false."**  

#### Key Explanations:
- **When satisfied?**  
  Only if `a` is **constantly true** and `b` is **constantly false** for the entire duration of the system's execution.  
- **Constraints imposed**:  
  - `a` **cannot** be false at any point.  
  - `b` **cannot** be true at any point.  
  - There are **no exceptions**: The system **always** adheres to `a ∧ ¬b`.  
- **Timeline perspective**:  
  If visualized over time, every state in the sequence satisfies:  
  ```
  Time t0: [a=true, b=false]  
  Time t1: [a=true, b=false]  
  Time t2: [a=true, b=false]  
  ... (forever)
  ```

### Why This Phrasing?
- **Clarity**: Explicitly ties `a`/`b` to "all times" and uses "must" to emphasize constraint.  
- **Correctness**: Captures the **synchrony** of `a ∧ ¬b` (both conditions in the same moment) and the **perpetuity** of `G`.  
- **Distribution Note**: `G(a ∧ ¬b)` is logically equivalent to `(G a) ∧ (G ¬b)`, meaning "`a` holds globally and `b` is globally false." Both interpretations align.  

This formula forbids any deviation from `a ∧ ¬b`—violation occurs if `a` is ever false or `b` is ever true.
