### Translation of LTL Formula: **G (!f | !i)**  
**Goal:** Map the formal LTL formula to natural language and explain when it holds, while highlighting constraints on the system.  

---

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:  
1. **Original Formula:**  
   `G (!f | !i)`  

2. **Parsing Tree (Breakdown):**  
   - **Root:** Temporal operator `G` (Globally).  
   - **Inner Operator:** Disjunction `|` (OR) between:  
     - `!f`: Negation of atomic proposition `f` (i.e., "`f` is false").  
     - `!i`: Negation of atomic proposition `i` (i.e., "`i` is false").  

   Visual Tree:  
   ```  
     G  
     |  
     OR  
    /  \  
   !f  !i  
   ```  

3. **Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up:**  
   - **Layer 1: Atomic Propositions**  
     - `!f`: "`f` is false" (absence of `f`).  
     - `!i`: "`i` is false" (absence of `i`).  
   - **Layer 2: Disjunction (|)**  
     - `!f | !i`: **"At least one of `f` or `i` is false"** (i.e., `f` and `i` cannot both be true simultaneously).  
   - **Layer 3: Globally (G)**  
     - `G (!f | !i)`: **"Every moment in time must satisfy `!f | !i`."**  
       → This prohibits any state where `f` and `i` are **both true** and requires that **at every future step**, at least one is false.  

4. **Key Constraints Imposed:**  
   - The formula is **violated** if there exists **any state** where `f` and `i` are simultaneously true.  
   - It is **satisfied** if in **all states**, `f` is false, `i` is false, or both are false.  

5. **Refined Natural Language Phrasing for Clarity:**  
   > **"Globally, `f` and `i` never occur together."**  
   or equivalently:  
   > **"`f` and `i` are mutually exclusive for all time."**

#### Why This Translation?  
- **`!f | !i` ≡ ¬(f ∧ i)**: By De Morgan’s law, "at least one false" ≡ "not both true."  
- **G enforces permanence**: The constraint applies to **every state** in the timeline without exception.  
- **Practical implication**: The system must prevent scenarios where both `f` and `i` hold concurrently.  

**Example:**  
- If `f = "full"` (a tank is full) and `i = "ignited"` (a burner is ignited), the formula states:  
  *"The tank must never be full while the burner is ignited."*
