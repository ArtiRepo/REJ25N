### Translation of LTL Formula: `a U !a`

#### Step 1: Original Formula  
`a U !a`

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
```
      U  
     / \  
    a   !  
        |  
        a  
```  
- **Leaves**:  
  - Left leaf: Atomic proposition `a` ("`a` is true in a state").  
  - Right leaf: Negation `!a` ("`a` is false in a state").  
- **Operator**:  
  - `U` ("until"): Combines `a` (left operand) and `!a` (right operand).  

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up  
1. **Atomic propositions**:  
   - `a` holds when the property `a` is true.  
   - `!a` holds when `a` is false.  
2. **Until (`U`) semantics**:  
   - `a U !a` requires:  
     - **Existence of a future state** where `!a` is true.  
     - **Continuity of `a`**: `a` must hold in **all states** from the **current state** until the state **right before** `!a` becomes true.  

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Translation  
**Literal meaning**:  
> "`a` is true continuously from now until the first moment it becomes false, and that moment must occur at some future time."  

**Refined for clarity and constraints**:  
- **When satisfied**:  
  - If `a` is **false in the current state** (trivial case), the formula holds.  
  - If `a` is **true now**, it must **remain true** until a **specific later state** where `a` turns false (and this state must exist).  
- **When it imposes constraints**:  
  - Forces `a` to **never persist indefinitely**: It guarantees `a` will **eventually fail** at least once.  
  - **Timing precision**: If `a` is true initially, it must hold **without gaps** until the **first violation** of `a`.  

**Final concise translation**:  
> "`a` remains true until its first failure, which must happen eventually."  

#### Key Insights:  
- **Equivalence to `F(!a)`**:  
  This formula is equivalent to "eventually `a` is false" (`F(!a)`) because:  
  - The requirement for `a` to hold until `!a` (at the first failure) is **automatically satisfied** when `!a` occurs (as earlier states then inherit continuity).  
- **Why structure matters**:  
  Breaking down `U` highlights the **continuity requirement** for `a` until the transition, even if it simplifies to eventual failure.  
- **Pitfall avoidance**:  
  The formula does **not require `a` to hold *at** the first-failure state—only **until immediately before it**.
