### Translation of LTL Formula: (c & b) U a

#### Step 1: Write the original LTL formula  
**Formula**: \( (c \land b) \mathrel{\textsf{U}} a \)  

#### Step 2: Parsing tree (breakdown)  
- **Top operator**: \(\mathrel{\textsf{U}}\) (Until)  
  - **Left child**: Conjunction \(\land\)  
    - **Leaf**: Atomic proposition \(c\)  
    - **Leaf**: Atomic proposition \(b\)  
  - **Right child**: Atomic proposition \(a\)  

**Tree Structure**:  
```
      U  
     / \  
    &   a  
   / \  
  c   b  
```

#### Step 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom up  
1. **Leaf nodes**:  
   - \(c\): "Condition \(c\) holds now."  
   - \(b\): "Condition \(b\) holds now."  
2. **Conjunction (\(\land\))**:  
   - \(c \land b\): "**Both \(c\) and \(b\) hold at the same time**."  
   - *Key insight*: This is a instantaneous condition a state must satisfy.  
3. **Until (\(\mathrel{\textsf{U}}\))**:  
   - \((c \land b) \mathrel{\textsf{U}} a\):  
     - "**Until \(a\) occurs, \(c \land b\) must hold continuously**, and **\(a\) must eventually occur**."  
   - *Key insights for \(\mathrel{\textsf{U}}\) semantics*:  
     - \(a\) **must become true at some future state**.  
     - For **all states from the current state up to (but excluding)** the state where \(a\) becomes true, **\(c \land b\) must hold**.  
     - If \(a\) is true now (at the current state), the interval is empty → \(c \land b\) is trivially satisfied (no constraints needed).  

#### Step 4: Refined natural language phrasing  
- **Concise phrasing**:  
  > "**Eventually \(a\) holds, and until that moment, both \(c\) and \(b\) hold continuously in every step.**"  
- **Explaining satisfaction/constraints**:  
  - **Satisfied if**:  
    - \(a\) holds at any future time (including now).  
    - For every state **before \(a\) holds**, both \(c\) and \(b\) hold (starting from the present state).  
  - **Violated if**:  
    - \(a\) **never** occurs, or  
    - \(c \land b\) **fails** in any state **before the first occurrence** of \(a\).  
- **Subtlety**: "Until that moment" excludes the state where \(a\) holds → after \(a\) becomes true, \(c \land b\) is no longer required.  

#### Example Timeline  
- **Valid path**: \([c \land b]\ → [c \land b] \ → [a] \ →\) (any conditions after).  
  - Here, \(a\) holds at step 2, and \(c \land b\) holds at steps 0 and 1.  
- **Invalid path**: \([c \land b] \ → [\neg c \land b] \ → [a]\).  
  - Fails because \(c \land b\) is broken in step 1 (before \(a\)).  

This translation balances technical precision (until excludes the target state) with natural flow using "until that moment."
