### Translation of LTL Formula: `F (!y & w)`

#### 1. **Original Formula:**  
`F (!y & w)`  

---

#### 2. **Parsing Tree (Breakdown):**  
- **Top operator:** `F` (Eventually)  
- **Subformula:** `(!y & w)` (logical conjunction)  
  - Left operand: `!y` (negation of atomic proposition `y`)  
  - Right operand: `w` (atomic proposition `w`)  

**Tree Structure:**  
```
     F  
     |  
    &  
   / \  
  !   w  
  |  
  y  
```

---

#### 3. **Rebuild Meaning Bottom-Up:**  
- **Atomic propositions:**  
  - `y`: "`y` is true."  
  - `w`: "`w` is true."  
- **Negation of `y` (`!y`):**  
  "`y` is false."  
- **Conjunction (`!y & w`):**  
  "`y` is false **and** `w` is true."  
  *(This requires both to hold **simultaneously** at a single time point.)*  
- **"Eventually" operator (`F`):**  
  **"At some future time**, `y` is false and `w` is true."  

---

#### 4. **Refined Natural Language Translation:**  
> "**Eventually, `w` becomes true while `y` is false**."  
*(Shorter: "`w` becomes true with `y` absent at some future point.")*  

#### Key Constraints:  
- The formula is satisfied **if there's any state** in the future where `w` holds and `y` fails.  
- It imposes a **global requirement**: The system **must** reach such a state eventually (if it hasn't already).  
- If `w` is true and `y` is false **now**, the formula is **immediately satisfied**.  

#### Timing Clarification:  
- The conditions for `w` and `!y` **must coincide** at the **same time point** (e.g., a future state where both are true simultaneously).  
- Wording like "while" or "at the same time" emphasizes simultaneity.  

---  
**Final Translation:**  
"Eventually, `w` holds and `y` does not hold **at the same future time**."
