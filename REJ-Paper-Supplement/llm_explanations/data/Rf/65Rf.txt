### Translation of LTL Formula: **Xa U Xb**

#### 1. **Original LTL Formula**  
   \( \text{X}a \ \text{U} \ \text{X}b \)  

#### 2. **Parsing Tree Breakdown**  
```
     U
    / \
   X   X
   |   |
   a   b
```
- **Leaves**:  
  - \( \text{X}a \): "Next \( a \)" (At the immediate next time step, \( a \) is true).  
  - \( \text{X}b \): "Next \( b \)" (At the immediate next time step, \( b \) is true).  
- **Root operator**:  
  - \( \text{U} \) (Until): The left operand (\( \text{X}a \)) must hold continuously **until** the right operand (\( \text{X}b \)) holds.  

#### 3. **Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up**  
- **Step 1: Interpret leaves**  
  - \( \text{X}a \): True if \( a \) holds at **time 1**.  
  - \( \text{X}b \): True if \( b \) holds at **time 1**.  
- **Step 2: Apply the \( \text{U} \) operator**  
  - \( \text{X}a \ \text{U} \ \text{X}b \) requires:  
    - A future state \( j \) (starting from time 0) where \( \text{X}b \) holds (i.e., \( b \) is true at **time \( j + 1 \)**).  
    - For all states before \( j \) (i.e., times \( k \) where \( 0 \leq k < j \)), \( \text{X}a \) holds (i.e., \( a \) is true at **time \( k + 1 \)**).  
  - **Implications**:  
    - \( j = 0 \):  
      - \( \text{X}b \) must hold at time 0 → \( b \) true at **time 1**.  
      - No prior states → no requirement for \( a \).  
    - \( j = 1 \):  
      - \( \text{X}b \) holds at time 1 → \( b \) true at **time 2**.  
      - \( \text{X}a \) must hold at time 0 → \( a \) true at **time 1**.  
    - \( j = 2 \):  
      - \( b \) true at **time 3**.  
      - \( a \) true at times **1** (from \( k=0 \)) and **2** (from \( k=1 \)).  
  - **Summary of requirement**:  
    \( b \) must be true at some time \( n \geq 1 \), and \( a \) must hold **from time 1 until time \( n-1 \)**.  
    - If \( n = 1 \), no \( a \) required.  
    - If \( n > 1 \), \( a \) holds continuously from time 1 to time \( n-1 \).  

#### 4. **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**  
> "Starting from the next time step, \( a \) holds continuously until the step before \( b \) becomes true. \( b \) must eventually hold in a future step."  

**Explanation**:  
- The formula does **not** constrain the current state (time 0).  
- It enforces:  
  - \( b \) **must become true** at some time \( \geq 1 \) (critical for \( \text{U} \)).  
  - If \( b \) is not true at time 1, \( a \) must hold **from time 1** until the **immediate predecessor** of the step where \( b \) becomes true.  
- **Key nuance**:  
  - \( a \) is **not required** at the same time \( b \) holds.  
  - Once \( b \) holds, the obligation for \( a \) ends.  

**Example**:  
- *Satisfied*:  
  - States: \( b \) true at time 1.  
  - States: \( a \) true at time 1, \( b \) true at time 2.  
  - States: \( a \) true at time 1, \( a \) true at time 2, \( b \) true at time 3.  
- *Violated*:  
  - \( b \) never holds (violates \( \text{U} \)).  
  - \( b \) true at time 2, but \( a \) false at time 1.  

#### Final Concise Translation  
**"By the next step, \( a \) persists until just before \( b \) occurs, and \( b \) eventually occurs."**
