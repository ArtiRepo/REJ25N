### Step-by-Step Reasoning for LTL Formula: `(a U b) and G(a)`

#### 1. **Original LTL Formula**:  
   `(a U b) and G(a)`

#### 2. **Parsing Tree (Breakdown)**:  
   - **Top-level operator**: `AND` (conjunction) with two children:
     - Left child: `(a U b)`  
       - Operator: `U` (until) with two children:  
         - Left: Atomic proposition `a`  
         - Right: Atomic proposition `b`  
     - Right child: `G(a)`  
       - Operator: `G` (globally) with one child:  
         - Atomic proposition `a`  

#### 3. **Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up**:  
   - **Atomic propositions** (`a`, `b`):  
     - `a`: Proposition `a` holds at a specific time.  
     - `b`: Proposition `b` holds at a specific time.  

   - **Subformula `G(a)`**:  
     - Meaning: Globally, `a` is true.  
     - Explanation: At **all** time steps (now and forever), `a` holds.  
     - Natural language: "`a` is always true."  

   - **Subformula `(a U b)`**:  
     - Meaning: `a` holds **until** `b` becomes true.  
     - Explanation: There exists a future time where `b` holds, and at **every** step before that time, `a` holds.  
       - **Critical nuance**: The `until` requires that `b` **eventually** occurs.  
     - Natural language: "`a` holds continuously until `b` becomes true, and `b` must eventually happen."  

   - **Top-level `AND` operator**:  
     - Combines `(a U b)` and `G(a)`.  
     - Meaning: **Both** subformulas must hold.  

#### 4. **Interaction Refinement**:  
   - `G(a)` forces `a` to be true **forever** (at all times).  
   - `(a U b)` requires `b` to occur **sometime** (say at time `t`) and `a` to hold until then.  
     - Since `G(a)` ensures `a` holds at `t` **and after**, `(a U b)` is almost redundant **except** that it enforces `b` must occur.  
     - Without `b` occurring, `(a U b)` fails—even if `G(a)` holds.  
   - **Key Insight**: `G(a)` already satisfies the condition of `a` holding until `b` (since `a` holds before, at, and after `b`). Thus, the only new constraint from `(a U b)` is that **`b` must eventually become true**.  

#### 5. **Unified Translation**:  
   The formula simplifies to:  
   > **`a` holds at every time step, and `b` must be true at least once in the future.**  

#### 6. **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**:  
   > **"`a` is true forever, and `b` becomes true at some future time."**  
   
   - **Why this captures the formula**:  
     - `G(a)` ensures `a` holds perpetually (no temporal constraints violated).  
     - `(a U b)` ensures `b` eventually occurs (the only independent constraint added).  
     - The `until` condition is automatically satisfied by `G(a)`, as `a` never fails, even when/after `b` occurs.  

#### Final Answer:  
**The LTL formula `(a U b) and G(a)` means:**  
> *"`a` must be true at all times (now and forever), and `b` must be true at least once in the future."*
