### Translation of LTL Formula: `b & X (a U c)`  

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:  
1. **Original formula:** `b & X (a U c)`  
2. **Parsing tree breakdown (from leaves to root):**  
   - Atomic propositions: `a`, `b`, `c` (base states).  
   - Inner subformula: `a U c` ("until" operator).  
     - Meaning: *"`a` holds continuously **until** `c` occurs, and `c` must eventually occur."*  
   - Temporal operator `X`: Applies to `(a U c)`.  
     - Meaning: *"In the **next** time step, `(a U c)` holds."*  
   - Logical operator `&` (AND): Combines `b` and `X(a U c)`.  
     - Meaning: *"`b` holds now **and** the next-state condition `X(a U c)` holds."*  

3. **Rebuilding meaning (bottom-up):**  
   - **Base:** `(a U c)` requires `a` to be true in every step until `c` becomes true, with a guarantee that `c` eventually occurs.  
   - **Add `X`:** `X(a U c)` shifts this requirement to start from the **next time step**.  
     - *Example:* If the timeline starts at time `t=0`, then `(a U c)` must hold starting at `t=1`.  
     - Constraints: `a U c` at `t=1` requires:  
       - `c` occurs at some future `t=k` (where `k ≥ 1`), and  
       - `a` holds for all steps from `t=1` to `t=k-1`.  
   - **Add `b &`:** Combines the requirement that `b` is true **now** (at `t=0`).  

4. **Refined natural language phrasing:**  
   > *"`b` is true **now**, and starting from the **next moment**: `a` must hold continuously **until** `c` occurs (with `c` eventually becoming true)."*  

#### Key Constraints Explained:  
- **Satisfaction at `t=0`:**  
  - `b` **must be true** at the current time (`t=0`).  
  - The formula imposes **no direct requirement** on `a` or `c` at `t=0`.  
- **Constraints for `t≥1`:**  
  - Starting at `t=1`, `a` must hold *at least until* `c` becomes true.  
  - `c` must occur **sometime after** `t=0` (i.e., no later than `t=∞`, but finitely).  
  - If `c` occurs at `t=k` (`k≥1`), `a` must be true from `t=1` to `t=k-1` (if `k>1`).  
- **If `c` never occurs?**  
  - The `(a U c)` subformula fails → the entire formula fails.  

#### Final Translation:  
> **"`b` holds now, and from the very next moment onward, `a` must remain true until `c` eventually becomes true."**
