### Step-by-Step Translation of LTL Formula: `a & X b`

#### 1. **Original LTL Formula**  
   `a & X b`

---

#### 2. **Parsing Tree Breakdown**  
   - **Root**: Conjunction (`&`), with two children:  
     - **Left child**: Atomic proposition `a` (base proposition).  
     - **Right child**: Unary temporal operator `X` (Next), applied to:  
       - **Child of `X`**: Atomic proposition `b` (base proposition).  

```
     &
    / \
   a   X
        \
         b
```

#### 3. **Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up**  
   - **Step 1: Interpret base propositions**  
     - `a` means: "`a` is true **now**" (in the current state).  
     - `b` means: "`b` is true **now**" (in the current state).  
   - **Step 2: Apply the `X` (Next) operator**  
     - `X b` means: "`b` is true in the **very next state**" (the immediate successor state).  
   - **Step 3: Apply the conjunction (`&`)**  
     - `a & (X b)` means: "`a` is true **now**, **and simultaneously** (from the perspective of the current state) `b` is true in the **immediately following state**".

#### 4. **Refined Natural Language Translation**  
   > "**`a` holds now, and in the next state, `b` holds.**"  

   - **Key Explanations**:  
     - **When satisfied?**  
       The formula is true **in the current state** only if:  
       (a) `a` is true **in the current state**, and  
       (b) `b` is true **in the next state** of the path.  
     - **Constraints over time**:  
       - It links two consecutive states:  
         1. **Current state (`t=0`)**: `a` must hold.  
         2. **Immediately next state (`t=1`)**: `b` must hold.  
       - *No requirements* beyond these states (e.g., `t=2+` is unconstrained).  
     - **Why "now" and "next"?**  
       - `X` explicitly shifts focus to the **directly adjacent future state**.  
       - Conjunction (`&`) binds both conditions to the **evaluation timing**: `a` is checked at the current step, while `X b` binds future behavior.  

### Final Translation  
The LTL formula `a & X b` translates to:  
> **"`a` is true in the current state, and `b` is true in the next state."**  

This means the system must satisfy `a` immediately and `b` in the immediate future. For example:  
- At time `t=0`: `a = true`  
- At time `t=1`: `b = true`  
*(States beyond `t=1` are irrelevant to this formula.)*
