### Step-by-Step Reasoning for LTL Formula: `F x | F y`

#### 1. **Original LTL Formula**:  
`F x | F y`

#### 2. **Parsing Tree Breakdown**:  
- **Leaf-level subformulas**: Atomic propositions `x` and `y`.  
- **Unary temporal operators**:  
  - `F x` ("Eventually `x`").  
  - `F y` ("Eventually `y`").  
- **Top-level binary operator**:  
  - `|` (logical **OR**).  
  - Structure: `(F x) | (F y)`.  

**Parsing Tree**:  
```
     OR  
    /   \  
  F x    F y  
   |      |  
   x      y  
```

#### 3. **Rebuild Meaning from Bottom-Up**:  
- **Step 1 (Atomic propositions)**:  
  - `x`: A state where property `x` holds.  
  - `y`: A state where property `y` holds.  

- **Step 2 (Unary operators `F`)**:  
  - `F x`: **"`x` eventually holds at least once in the future."**  
    - *Example*: If the trace is `[x, y]`, `x` is satisfied at the first step.  
  - `F y`: **"`y` eventually holds at least once in the future."**  
    - *Example*: In `[y, x]`, `y` is satisfied at the first step.  

- **Step 3 (Binary operator `|`)**:  
  - `(F x) | (F y)`: **"At least one of `F x` or `F y` holds."**  
  - *Combined logic*:  
    - If **either** `x` eventually occurs **or** `y` eventually occurs (or both), the formula is satisfied.  
    - Only **fails** if **neither** `x` nor `y` ever occurs.  

#### 4. **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**:  
- **Key refinement**: Clarify temporal flexibility and mutual exclusivity:  
  > **"Eventually, either `x` happens or `y` happens (or both)."**  

- **Explanation of constraints over time**:  
  - **Satisfaction condition**: The system must guarantee that **at least one** of the two events occurs *at some point* (timing is irrelevant; they can happen at the same or different times).  
  - **Failure scenario**: The formula is **violated** if the system **never** reaches a state where `x` holds **and never** reaches a state where `y` holds.  
  - **No order dependency**: No constraint is imposed on the order between `x` and `y`; they may occur in any sequence.  

**Example Traces**:  
- `[x]`, `[y]`, `[x, y]`, `[y, x]`: **Satisfied** (one or both occur).  
- `[ ]` (neither `x` nor `y` ever occurs): **Violated**.  

### Final Translation  
**LTL Formula**: `F x | F y`  
**Natural Language**:  
> *Eventually, either `x` happens or `y` happens (or both occur at any times).  
The system violates this only if neither event ever occurs.*
