### Translation of the LTL Formula: `X a & !G b`

#### Step 1: Original Formula  
`X a & !G b`

---

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
The formula is parsed as a conjunction (`&`), combining two subformulas:  
```
      &
     / \
    X   !
    |   |
    a   G
        |
        b
```  
- **Left branch**: `X a`  
  - `X` is the *Next* operator.  
  - `a` is an atomic proposition (e.g., "the light is on").  
- **Right branch**: `!G b`  
  - `!` (negation) applied to `G b`.  
  - `G` is the *Globally* operator ("always in the future").  
  - `b` is an atomic proposition (e.g., "the door is locked").  

---

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up  
Start from the leaves (atomic propositions) and move upward:  
1. **`a` and `b`**:  
   - `a`: "Condition `a` holds in the current state."  
   - `b`: "Condition `b` holds in the current state."  
   *(Interpretation depends on system semantics)*  

2. **`X a`**:  
   - *Next* operator shifts focus to the **immediately following state**.  
   - Meaning: "**In the next state**, condition `a` holds."  

3. **`G b`**:  
   - *Globally* applies to **all states from now onward**.  
   - Meaning: "**For all future states** (including now), condition `b` holds."  

4. **`!G b`**:  
   - Negation flips "always `b`" to "not always `b`".  
   - Meaning: "It is **not true that `b` holds forever**."  
   - Equivalently: "**There exists at least one future state** (starting now) where `b` fails."  

5. **`X a & !G b`**:  
   - Conjunction (`&`) requires **both subformulas to hold simultaneously at the current state**.  
   - Meaning:  
     - "**In the next state**, `a` holds."  
     - "**Sometime in the future** (from now), `b` fails at least once."

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Translation  
Refine for clarity and conciseness:  
- **Key Insight**:  
  - `X a`: Constrains **only the very next state** (a single moment).  
  - `!G b` → `F !b`: Constrains **any future state** (could be next, later, or even now).  
  - The two requirements are **independent**:  
    - `a` **must** hold at the next state.  
    - `b` **must fail at least once** in the current or future states.  

- **Final Translation**:  
  > "The system **must satisfy `a` in the next state, and `b` must fail at least once (either now or in the future)."  

- **Why This Phrasing?**  
  - Separates the **immediate constraint** (`a` in the next state) from the **eventual constraint** (`b` failing eventually).  
  - Clarifies that `b`’s failure can occur:  
    - **Now**: Current state has `b` false, *or*  
    - **Soon**: Next state (with `a` true and `b` false), *or*  
    - **Later**: Any state after next (allowing `b` to be true next).  
  - Example Scenarios:  
    - ✅ Valid: `b` false *now*, `a` true *next*.  
    - ✅ Valid: `a` true and `b` true *next*, but `b` false *later*.  
    - ❌ Invalid: `a` false next, *or* `b` true forever.  

<u>Alternative Phrasing</u>:  
"At the next moment, `a` must hold; and `b` cannot hold everywhere forever (i.e., it must eventually fail)."

### Final Answer  
`X a & !G b` translates to:  
**"In the next state, `a` holds; and `b` fails at least once from now onward."**
