### Translation of LTL Formula: `G t | F w`

#### Step 1: Original Formula  
- **Formula:** `G t | F w`  
- **Operator Precedence:** Unary operators (`G`, `F`) bind tighter than binary operators (`|`). Thus, the formula parses as `(G t) | (F w)`.

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
```
      OR (|)
     /     \
   G(t)    F(w)
    |       |
    t       w
```

- **Leaves (Atomic Propositions):**  
  - `t`: Truth of atomic proposition `t` at the current state (represents "t holds now").  
  - `w`: Truth of atomic proposition `w` at the current state (represents "w holds now").  
- **Unary Operators (Applied Bottom-Up):**  
  - `G t`: Globally enforces `t` for **all future states** (including the current state).  
  - `F w`: Finally requires `w` to hold in **at least one future state** (current or later).  
- **Binary Operator (Combines Subformulas):**  
  - `|`: Logical OR between `G t` and `F w` (satisfied if either/both subformulas hold).

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up  
1. **Atomic Propositions:**  
   - `t` means "t holds **now**".  
   - `w` means "w holds **now**".  
   *→ Placeholders for state-specific conditions.*  

2. **Apply Temporal Operators:**  
   - `G t`: Expands to "**For all states from now onward, t holds**".  
     - *Constraint:* `t` must never fail in the entire future.  
   - `F w`: Expands to "**There exists a state from now onward where w holds**".  
     - *Constraint:* `w` must occur **at least once** in the future.  

3. **Apply OR Operator (`|`):**  
   - Combines `G t` and `F w`:  
     - Satisfied if **either** `G t` is true (t holds forever), **or** `F w` is true (w eventually occurs), **or both**.  
     - *System Behavior*:  
       - If `t` holds continuously forever, the formula is satisfied (regardless of `w`).  
       - If `t` ever fails, the system **must ensure `w` occurs eventually** to satisfy the formula.  

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Phrasing  
> **"The system must either:**  
> (a) **Always maintain `t` true from now on indefinitely,  
> or**  
> (b) **Ensure `w` eventually becomes true at least once in the future.  
> (Both conditions may hold simultaneously.)"**  

#### Key Nuances:  
- **Implicit Constraint:** If `t` fails at any point (now or later), the system is **forced** to eventually satisfy `w`.  
- **Minimal Compliance:** The system can **choose** to never satisfy `w`, but only if it **never lets `t` fail**.  
- **Time Sensitivity:** `G t` requires immediate and perpetual truth of `t`; `F w` allows arbitrary delays (as long as `w` eventually happens).  

#### Example Scenarios:  
- ✅ Acceptable: `t=true, t=true, t=true, ...` (t always true, no `w` needed).  
- ✅ Acceptable: `t=false, w=true` (t fails immediately, but `w` immediately occurs).  
- ✅ Acceptable: `t=true, t=false, w=true` (t fails, but `w` occurs later).  
- ❌ Violation: `t=false, w=false, w=false, ...` (t fails and `w` never occurs).  

### Final Translation  
**"Either `t` holds permanently from now on, or `w` must eventually occur."**
