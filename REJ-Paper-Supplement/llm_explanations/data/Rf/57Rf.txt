### Translation of LTL Formula: \( F a \land G(a \to X G \lnot a) \)

#### 1. **Original Formula**:  
\( F a \land G(a \to X G \lnot a) \)

#### 2. **Parsing Tree Breakdown** (bottom-up):  
- **Leaves**:  
  - Atomic proposition \( a \).  
  - Negation \( \lnot a \).  
- **Next-level operators**:  
  - \( G \lnot a \): "Globally \( \lnot a \)" (always false from a point onward).  
  - \( X(G \lnot a) \): "Next \( G \lnot a \)" (starting from the **next** state, \( \lnot a \) always holds).  
- **Implication**:  
  - \( a \to X G \lnot a \): "If \( a \) holds now, then from the **next state**, \( a \) is **always false**."  
- **Higher operators**:  
  - \( G(a \to X G \lnot a) \): "**Globally**, if \( a \) is true now, then it will be **permanently false** starting next."  
  - \( F a \): "Eventually \( a \) is true."  
- **Conjunction**:  
  - Both subformulas must hold: "Eventually \( a \) **and** the global implication."  

#### 3. **Rebuilding Meaning from Bottom-Up**:  
- **Innermost (leaf)**:  
  - \( \lnot a \) means "\( a \) is false."  
- **Next layer**:  
  - \( G \lnot a \) means "\( a \) will be false **forever** after a starting point."  
  - \( X(G \lnot a) \) shifts this to the **next state**: "Starting tomorrow, \( a \) will be **false forever**."  
- **Implication**:  
  - \( a \to X G \lnot a \) means: "If \( a \) is true **today**, then **tomorrow onward, \( a \) is always false.**"  
- **Global scope**:  
  - \( G(\cdot) \) forces this rule to hold **at every state**: "Whenever \( a \) is true, it **never reappears** afterward."  
- **Eventuality**:  
  - \( F a \) requires \( a \) to be true **at least once**.  
- **Conjunction**:  
  - Combining both: A system where:  
    1. \( a \) **eventually becomes true** (due to \( F a \)).  
    2. Every time \( a \) is true, it **stays false forever afterward** (due to \( G(a \to X G \lnot a) \)).  

#### 4. **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**:  
> "The proposition \( a \) holds **exactly once** in the entire timeline. It eventually becomes true at some state, and **from the very next state onward, it remains permanently false**."  

#### **Key Insights**:  
- **Why "exactly once"?**  
  - \( F a \) ensures \( a \) occurs **at least once**.  
  - \( G(a \to X G \lnot a) \) ensures **no recurrence**: the first time \( a \) is true, it forces \( a \) to be false forever afterward. If \( a \) could reappear later, it would violate the implication at the earlier state where \( a \) was true.  
- **Timing**:  
  - When \( a \) is true at time \( t \), the constraint starts at \( t+1 \): \( a \) must be false at \( t+1, t+2, \ldots \).  
  - States before \( a \)’s occurrence are unconstrained (if \( a \) is false earlier, the implication \( a \to \cdots \) holds vacuously).  

**Example Trace**:  
`[a=false, a=false, a=true, a=false, a=false, ...]` (a holds **only once** at step 3, then remains false).  

\[ \boxed{\text{a must eventually be true at \textbf{exactly one point}, and then be \textbf{permanently false} for all future states starting from the next one.}} \]
