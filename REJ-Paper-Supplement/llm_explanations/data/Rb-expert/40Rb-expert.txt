### Step-by-Step Translation of LTL Formula: `F (o | u)`

#### 1. **Original LTL Formula**:  
`F (o | u)`  

---

#### 2. **Breakdown into Parsing Tree**:  
The formula has a simple hierarchical structure:  
- **Root operator**: `F` (the **Eventually** temporal operator).  
- **Subformula**: `(o | u)` (a **logical OR** between atomic propositions `o` and `u`).  
- **Atomic propositions**:  
  - `o` (e.g., "the system is in state `o`").  
  - `u` (e.g., "the system is in state `u`").  

**Parsing Tree Visualization**:  
```
     F  
     │  
     ∨  
    ( | )  
    /   \  
   o     u  
```

---

#### 3. **Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up**:

- **Step 1: Atomic propositions (`o`, `u`)**  
  - `o`: Represents a specific state/fact (e.g., "a notification is sent").  
  - `u`: Represents another state/fact (e.g., "a user intervenes").  
  - *Semantics*: These are the base conditions that must hold at a specific point in time.  

- **Step 2: Logical OR (`o | u`)**  
  - **Meaning**: Either `o` is true **or** `u` is true at a given time (or both). For example:  
    > "`o` occurs **OR** `u` occurs at time *t*."  
  - *Key Point*: This is a **non-temporal** logical operator; it only constrains the current state, not the timeline.  

- **Step 3: Temporal Operator `F` (Eventually)**  
  - **Meaning**: "At some **future time**, the subformula must hold." Applied to `(o | u)`, this becomes:  
    > "Eventually, either `o` or `u` **must become true**."  
  - *Temporal Constraint*: The system must **eventually** reach a state where either `o` or `u` (or both) occurs. There is **no guarantee** about when this happens, but it must occur at least once in the future.

#### 4. **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**:  
To ensure clarity and alignment with the formula’s constraints, refine the translation:  
> "**Eventually, either `o` occurs or `u` occurs (or both).**"  

**Key Nuances Explained**:  
- **"Eventually"** (`F`): Indicates a **future obligation** but allows any time frame (e.g., next state, far future).  
- **"Either ... or"** (`|`): Specifies that **at least one** of `o` or `u` must hold. Both can be true simultaneously.  
- **Failure Condition**: The formula is **violated** only if the system **never** enters a state where `o` or `u` is true.  

---

**Why this phrasing?**  
- **No ambiguity**: Clearly separates temporal ("eventually") from logical ("either/or").  
- **Minimalist**: Avoids overcomplicating implications (e.g., doesn’t forbid repeated occurrences).  
- **System constraints**: Directly maps to a requirement for the system to eventually satisfy `o` ∨ `u`.  

**Final Translation**:  
> **"The system must eventually reach a state where either `o` or `u` (or both) is true."**
