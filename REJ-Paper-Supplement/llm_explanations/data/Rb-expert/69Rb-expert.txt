### Translation of LTL Formula: FGa

#### 1. **Original Formula**  
`FGa` (formally parsed as `F(G a)`).

#### 2. **Parsing Tree Breakdown**  
- **Atomic proposition**: `a` (a basic statement about the system state, e.g., "the light is on").  
- **Unary operator `G`**: Applies to `a` → `G a` ("Globally, `a`").  
- **Unary operator `F`**: Applies to `G a` → `F(G a)` ("Eventually, `G a`").  

Tree structure:  
```
    F  
    │  
    G  
    │  
    a  
```

#### 3. **Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up**  
- **Base: `a`**  
  - "Proposition `a` holds **now** (in the current state)."  
- **Apply `G`: `G a`**  
  - "`a` holds **in every future state** (including the present)."  
  - *Constraint*: From the current moment forward, `a` must **never** be false.  
- **Apply `F`: `F(G a)`**  
  - "**At some future moment**, `G a` becomes true."  
  - *Constraint*: The system must reach a state **from which `a` holds forever thereafter**.  

#### 4. **Refined Natural Language Translation**  
> **"Eventually, 'a' becomes permanently true."**  
> (Equivalently: "There exists a point in the future after which 'a' holds forever.")  

#### Key Implications:  
- **Satisfaction condition**: The formula is satisfied if, at **any point** in the execution:  
  1. `a` becomes true, **and**  
  2. `a` **stays true in all subsequent states forever**.  
- **Violation**: If `a` **never stabilizes to true permanently** (e.g., `a` alternates/reverts to false infinitely often), the formula is violated.  

#### Examples:  
| Sequence of `a`          | Satisfies `FGa`? | Explanation                                  |  
|--------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|  
| `[F, F, F, T, T, T, ...]`| **Yes**          | `a` becomes true at step 3 and **stays true forever**. |  
| `[T, T, T, ...]`         | **Yes**          | `a` is immediately/stably true.              |  
| `[F, T, F, T, F, ...]`   | **No**           | `a` never **stays** true permanently.        |  
| `[F, F, F, ...]`         | **No**           | `a` never becomes true.                      |  

#### Formal Nuance:  
The formula requires a **specific stabilization point** in the timeline. Once reached, `a` **cannot** revert to false in any future state. This distinguishes `FGa` from weaker formulas like `GFa` (infinitely often true, but not necessarily permanently).
