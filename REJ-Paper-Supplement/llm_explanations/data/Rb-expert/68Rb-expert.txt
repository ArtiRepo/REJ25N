### Translation of LTL Formula: **a U b**

#### 1. **Original LTL Formula**:  
`a U b`

#### 2. **Parsing Tree Breakdown**:  
```
     U
    / \
   a   b
```
- **Leaves**: Atomic propositions.  
  - `a`: "`a` is true."  
  - `b`: "`b` is true."  
- **Operator**: `U` (*Until*) is a binary temporal operator.  
  - Semantics:  
    `a U b` is satisfied **iff** there exists a future state where `b` holds, and for every state from the current state up to (but not including) that future state, `a` holds.  

#### 3. **Rebuilding Meaning (Bottom-Up)**:
- **Base Case**:  
  - `a`: True in the current state.  
  - `b`: True at some future state.  
- **Operator Semantics**:  
  `a U b` requires:  
  - **Eventuality**: `b` must become true at some future time (say, at position `j`).  
  - **Invariance**: From the **current state (inclusive)** until **exclusively before `j`**, `a` must hold in every state.  
    - *Note*: At state `j` (where `b` becomes true), `a` can be *true or false*.

#### 4. **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**:  
> "**Eventually, `b` becomes true, and at every state until `b` becomes true, `a` holds."  

**Detailed Explanation**:  
- **Satisfaction Cases**:  
  - If `b` is **currently true**, `a U b` holds immediately (no need for `a` to be true).  
  - If `b` is **future true** at time `j` (after `≥1` steps), `a` must be true in **all states from now until (and when `j>0`)** for all states between the current state and the state immediately preceding `j`; and `b` must be true at `j`.  
- **Violation Cases**:  
  - `b` **never becomes true**, OR  
  - `b` eventually becomes true, but `a` **fails to hold** in any state between the current state and the state immediately preceding the occurrence of `b`.  
- **Temporal Constraint**:  
  - If `b` happens at step `j`, `a` must be true in steps `0` to `j-1` (relative to the current state as step `0`).  

**Example**:  
- *Valid path*: `a=true, a=true, b=true, ...` (`a` holds until `b` appears).  
- *Invalid path*: `a=false, ...` (fails if `a` is false now, even if `b` later becomes true).  

**Clarification**:  
The phrasing "until `b` becomes true" implies:  
1. `b` **must eventually occur**.  
2. `a` must hold **continuously** up to the state *just before* `b` occurs.  
After `b` is true, `a` has no constraints (regardless of its value).  

This captures both **eventuality** (`b` must happen) and **safety** (`a` must persist up to `b`).
