### Translation of LTL Formula: (a U b) and G(a)

#### Step 1: Original LTL Formula
\[
(a \mathbin{\text{U}} b) \land \mathop{\text{G}}(a)
\]

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown
The formula consists of a top-level conjunction (`AND`). The two subformulas are:
- **Left operand**: \(a \mathbin{\text{U}} b\) (until)
- **Right operand**: \(\mathop{\text{G}}a\) (globally)

Tree structure:
```
         AND
        /   \
       U     G
      / \    |
     a   b   a
```

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up
1. **Atomic propositions**:
   - \(a\): "Property \(a\) holds in the current state."
   - \(b\): "Property \(b\) holds in the current state."

2. **Subformula \(a \mathbin{\text{U}} b\)**:
   - **Definition**: \(a \mathbin{\text{U}} b\) requires:
     - There exists a **future state** where \(b\) holds.
     - For **all states** leading up to (but not necessarily including) that future state, \(a\) holds.
   - **Natural language**:  
     *"\(a\) holds continuously until \(b\) becomes true, and \(b\) must eventually become true."*

3. **Subformula \(\mathop{\text{G}}a\)**:
   - **Definition**: \(\mathop{\text{G}}a\) requires \(a\) to hold in **all future states**.
   - **Natural language**:  
     *"\(a\) holds in every future state (forever)."*

4. **Combining with \(AND\)**:
   - The full formula \((a \mathbin{\text{U}} b) \land \mathop{\text{G}}a\) requires both subformulas to hold simultaneously.  
   - **Interaction analysis**:
     - \(a \mathbin{\text{U}} b\) requires:
       - \(a\) holds until \(b\) occurs.
       - \(b\) eventually occurs.
     - \(\mathop{\text{G}}a\) forces \(a\) to hold **after** \(b\) occurs (since \(a\) must hold forever).
     - Thus, \(\mathop{\text{G}}a\) **overrides** the "until" constraint after \(b\), making it redundant.  
       The conjunction simplifies to:  
       \[
       \mathop{\text{G}}a \land \mathop{\text{F}}b
       \]
       (i.e., "\(a\) is always true, and \(b\) is eventually true").

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Phrasing
- **Concise translation**:  
  *"Property \(a\) holds forever, and property \(b\) eventually holds at least once."*  
- **Complete explanation**:  
  *"The system must satisfy:*  
  1. \(a\) *is true in every future state (for all time),*  
  2. \(b\) *becomes true at some future state.*  
  *Since \(a\) holds perpetually, \(b\) must occur while \(a\) is true, and \(a\) remains true even after \(b\) occurs."*

#### Why This Phrasing?
- **Clarity**: Explicitly separates the two requirements (perpetual \(a\) and eventual \(b\)) while noting that \(a \mathbin{\text{U}} b\) is satisfied implicitly by \(\mathop{\text{G}}a\) and \(\mathop{\text{F}}b\).  
- **Avoids redundancy**: Omits the "until" detail after \(b\), as \(\mathop{\text{G}}a\) dominates infinitely.  
- **Key insight**:  
  \(\mathop{\text{G}}a\) dominates the behavior, making \((a \mathbin{\text{U}} b)\) equivalent to \(\mathop{\text{F}}b\) here.  
  Constraints reduce to: \(a\) **never fails**, and \(b\) **eventually happens**.  

#### Final Translation
**Natural Language Equivalent**:  
*"Property \(a\) is always true, and property \(b\) becomes true at least once."*
