### Translation of LTL Formula: **F (!y & w)**

#### Step 1: Original LTL Formula  
**F (!y & w)**  

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
- **F** (eventually/always in the future)  
  - **&** (logical AND)  
    - **!y** (negation of `y` = "`y` is false")  
    - **w** (atomic proposition `w` = "`w` is true")  

Parsing tree:  
```
     F  
     |  
     &  
    / \  
   !   w  
   |    
   y    
```

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning from Bottom-Up  
1. **Leaf nodes:**  
   - `y` → "`y` is true"  
   - `!y` → Negates `y` → "**`y` is false**"  
   - `w` → "**`w` is true**"  

2. **Logical AND (`&`):**  
   - `!y & w` → Both subformulas must hold **simultaneously**:  
     "**`y` is false and `w` is true**" at the same moment.  

3. **Temporal Operator (`F`):**  
   - `F` requires the inner formula to hold **at least once** in the future (including the present):  
     "**Eventually** (now or later), there is a moment where `y` is false and `w` is true."  

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Phrasing  
> **"Eventually, `w` becomes true while `y` is false (at the same time)."**  

##### Key Clarifications:  
- **Scope of `F`**: The condition `!y & w` must occur **at least once** at a specific point in time (immediately or in the future).  
  - *Example*: If `w` turns true at any point where `y` is false, the formula holds. Afterward, `y` and `w` may change freely.  
- **Constraint**: The system is only forced to satisfy `w` and `¬y` **simultaneously once**. It does **not** require:  
  - `w` to stay true forever,  
  - `y` to stay false forever,  
  - Any guarantees about `w` or `y` individually outside this moment.  

##### When the Formula is Violated?  
If the system **never** enters a state where `w` is true and `y` is false simultaneously, the formula is **false**.  

###### Example Scenarios:  
- **Satisfied**: At time `t=3`, `y` is false and `w` is true (no other conditions imposed).  
- **Violated**: `w` is only true when `y` is also true, or `w` remains false forever while `y` is true.  

**Final Natural Language Expression**:  
> **"Eventually, `w` is true and `y` is false at the same moment."**
