### Translation of the LTL Formula: `!G c`

#### 1. **Original LTL Formula**  
`¬G c` (where `¬` is negation, `G` is the "Globally" operator, and `c` is an atomic proposition).  

#### 2. **Parsing Tree Breakdown**  
The parsing tree for `¬G c` is structured as follows:  
```
     ¬    (Negation)
      |
      G    (Globally operator)
      |
      c    (Atomic proposition)
```  
- **Leaf node**: `c` represents a system state or condition (e.g., "the system is secure").  
- **Unary operator**: `G` ("Globally") applies to `c`, forming the subformula `G c`.  
- **Outer operator**: `¬` ("Not") negates `G c`.  

#### 3. **Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up**  
- **Step 1: Atomic proposition (`c`)**  
  `c` is a Boolean condition that can be true or false at a specific point in time (e.g., "the door is closed").  

- **Step 2: Apply `G` ("Globally") to `c`**  
  `G c` requires that `c` holds **at every point in time**, starting from the initial state.  
  - *Meaning*: "`c` is always true forever (in all future states)."  
  - *Example*: "The door is **always** closed."  

- **Step 3: Apply `¬` (Negation) to `G c`**  
  `¬G c` negates the entire subformula `G c`, meaning `G c` **fails to hold**.  
  - *Logical implication*: It is **not true** that `c` holds at every point in time. Thus, there **must exist some point** (present or future) where `c` is false.  
  - *Equivalence*: `¬G c` is equivalent to `F ¬c` ("Eventually, not `c`"), where `F` is the "Eventually" operator.  
  - *Meaning*: "There is at least one moment where `c` is false."  

#### 4. **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**  
- **Core translation**: "It is not true that `c` holds **forever**."  
- **Stronger implication**: "`c` **must be false at least once**."  
- **Clarity refinements**:  
  - Explicitly state the requirement: The negation of "always" implies an **inevitable failure** of `c`.  
  - Avoid ambiguity: Specify that `c` failing once (at any time) satisfies the formula, even if `c` is mostly true.  
  - Temporal aspect: Emphasize that a violation **will occur in the timeline** (e.g., immediately, later, or repeatedly).  

**Final Natural Language Translation**:  
> "The condition `c` is **not always true**; it **must be false at least once** in the system's execution."  

##### Key Notes:  
- **When satisfied?** When there is **any state** (current or future) where `c` is false.  
- **Constraint imposed**: The system **cannot sustain `c` forever**; a violation **will occur**.  
- **Practical example**: If `c` is "the system is error-free," then `¬G c` requires: "At some point, an error occurs."
