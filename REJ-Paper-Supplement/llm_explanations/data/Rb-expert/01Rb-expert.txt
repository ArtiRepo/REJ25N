### Step-by-Step Translation of the LTL Formula: `X a => X c`

#### 1. **Original LTL Formula**  
`X a => X c`

#### 2. **Parsing Tree Breakdown**  
The formula is structured as follows:  
```
IMPLIES (=>)
  /   \
X(a)  X(c)
 |     |
 a     c
```  
- **Leaf nodes**: Atomic propositions `a` and `c` (e.g., `a = "valve_open"`, `c = "pressure_low"`).  
- **Next (X) operators**: Applied to `a` and `c` individually.  
- **Implication (=>)**: Connects the two subformulas `X a` and `X c`.  

#### 3. **Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up**  
- **Layer 1: Atomic propositions**  
  - `a`: A condition that may be true/false in a single state (e.g., "valve is open").  
  - `c`: Another condition (e.g., "pressure is low").  

- **Layer 2: Next (X) operators**  
  - `X a`: "**In the immediate next state** (from now), `a` holds."  
    *(Example: "In 1 timestep, the valve will be open.")*  
  - `X c`: "**In the immediate next state**, `c` holds."  
    *(Example: "In 1 timestep, the pressure will be low.")*  

- **Layer 3: Implication (=>)**  
  - `X a => X c`:  
    - **Meaning**: "**If `X a` is true, then `X c` must also be true**."  
    - **Logically**: At the current state, if the next state satisfies `a`, then the **same next state** must satisfy `c`.  
    - **Behavior**:  
      - If the next state has `a = true`, then `c` must be `true` in **that same state**.  
      - If the next state has `a = false`, the constraint does **not** require anything about `c` in the next state (the formula holds regardless).  

#### 4. **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**  
- **Key Clarifications**:  
  - **Time Focus**: The formula constrains the **immediate next state** relative to the current moment.  
  - **Scope**: It applies at **every state** in the system's timeline (LTL formulas implicitly quantify over all states unless specified otherwise).  
  - **Behavior**:  
    - When the next state satisfies `a`, it **must also satisfy `c`**.  
    - When the next state **does not satisfy `a`**, there is **no constraint** on `c`.  

- **Final Translation**:  
  > **"At every moment, if `a` holds in the next state, then `c` must also hold in that same next state."**  

- **Alternative Phrasings**:  
  > - "Whenever `a` becomes true in the immediate next state, `c` must be true simultaneously in that state."  
  > - "The condition `c` must be true in any next state where `a` is true."  

### When the Formula is Satisfied/Constrained  
| **Situation**                   | **Formula Satisfaction**                                  |  
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|  
| Next state has `a=true`, `c=true` | ✅ Satisfied.                                             |  
| Next state has `a=true`, `c=false`| ❌ **Violated:** `X a` is true but `X c` is false.         |  
| Next state has `a=false`, `c=true` | ✅ Satisfied (no obligation when `a` is false).         |  
| Next state has `a=false`, `c=false`| ✅ Satisfied (no obligation when `a` is false).         |  

### Example Concrete Scenario  
- **Proposition `a`**: "System receives shutdown command."  
- **Proposition `c`**: "Safety valve is activated."  
- **Translation**:  
  > "At every moment, if the system will receive a shutdown command in the next state, then the safety valve must be activated in that same next state."  
- **Violation Example**:  
  If the system receives a shutdown command at time `t+1` but fails to activate the valve at `t+1`.
