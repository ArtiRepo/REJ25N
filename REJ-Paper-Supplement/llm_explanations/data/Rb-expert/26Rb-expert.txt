### Translation of LTL Formula: \(X   t \implies X   y\)

#### Step 1: Original LTL Formula  
\(X   t \implies X   y\)  

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
- **Root**: Implication (\(\implies\))  
  - **Left child**: Temporal operator `X` (Next) applied to atomic proposition \(t\).  
  - **Right child**: Temporal operator `X` (Next) applied to atomic proposition \(y\).  

```  
     IMPLIES  
     /     \  
    X       X  
    |       |  
    t       y  
```

#### Step 3: Rebuild Meaning from Bottom Up  
1. **Base components**:  
   - \(X   t\): "At the **next** state/time step, \(t\) is true."  
   - \(X   y\): "At the **next** state/time step, \(y\) is true."  

2. **Combining with implication (\(\implies\))**:  
   The formula \(A \implies B\) means:  
   *If \(A\) holds, then \(B\) must hold.*  
   Here, \(A = X   t\) and \(B = X   y\). Thus:  
   *"If (at the next state, \(t\) is true), then (at the next state, \(y\) is true)."*  

#### Key Semantics:  
- **Trigger**: The condition (\(X   t\)) focuses **only** on the **immediately next state**.  
- **Constraint**: If \(t\) holds in the next state, then \(y\) must **simultaneously** hold in that **same state**.  
- **No obligation otherwise**:  
  - If \(t\) is **false** in the next state, the formula holds **regardless** of \(y\) (no constraint on \(y\)).  
- **Temporal scope**: Constrains **exactly one state**—the next immediate moment.  

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Phrasing  
> **"At the next time step, if \(t\) is true, then \(y\) must also be true."**  

#### Additional Insights:  
- **Why not "whenever"?**  
  "Whenever" suggests generality over multiple states, but `X` constrains **only the immediate next state**. Thus, "at the next time step" is precise.  
- **Implication nuances**:  
  - If \(t\) holds next → \(y\) **must** hold next.  
  - If \(t\) **does not hold** next → No requirement for \(y\) (often overlooked; the formula is **vacuously true** in this case).  
- **Practical example**:  
  *If a request (\(t\)) arrives in the next cycle, then an acknowledgment (\(y\)) must be sent in that same cycle.*  

#### Final Translation  
**Natural Language Requirement**:  
> "In the immediate next state, if \(t\) is true, then \(y\) must be true."
