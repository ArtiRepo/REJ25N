### Translation of LTL Formula: **G(a and !b)**

#### Step 1: Original Formula  
**G(a ∧ ¬b)**  

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
- **Top-level operator**: `G` (Globally)  
  - **Child formula**: `a ∧ ¬b` (logical AND)  
    - **Left child**: `a` (atomic proposition)  
    - **Right child**: `¬b` (logical NOT)  
      - **Child of ¬**: `b` (atomic proposition)  

Tree structure:  
```
     G  
     |  
     ∧  
    / \  
   a   ¬  
        \  
         b  
```

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up  
1. **Atomic propositions**:  
   - `a` means: "`a` is **true**".  
   - `b` means: "`b` is **true**".  

2. **Negation (`¬`)**:  
   - `¬b` means: "`b` is **false**".  

3. **Conjunction (`∧`)**:  
   - `a ∧ ¬b` means: "**`a` is true AND `b` is false**" simultaneously at the same instant.  

4. **Globally (`G`)**:  
   - `G(a ∧ ¬b)` means: The combined condition "`a` is true and `b` is false" must hold **at every future time step**, starting from now.  

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Phrasing  
- **Literal interpretation**:  
  > "At every moment in the future, `a` is true and `b` is false."  

- **Refined for clarity and system constraints**:  
  > "**Throughout the entire execution, `a` must always hold (be true), and `b` must never hold (always be false).**"  

##### Explanation:  
- **Satisfaction condition**:  
  The formula is satisfied **if and only if**:  
  - In the **current state** (`t=0`), `a` is true and `b` is false.  
  - In **every subsequent state** (`t=1, t=2, ...,` ad infinitum), `a` is true and `b` is false.  

- **Violation condition**:  
  The system violates this formula if **at any point** in the execution:  
  - `a` becomes false **or** `b` becomes true.  
  (Even a single breach at any future time invalidates the entire specification.)  

- **Key constraints**:  
  - `a` must **never be false**.  
  - `b` must **never be true**.  
  - Both constraints apply **eternally** to **all** future states.  

##### Example Traces:  
- **Valid trace**:  
  `[a=⊤, b=⊥] → [a=⊤, b=⊥] → [a=⊤, b=⊥] → ...`  
  (At every step: `a` true, `b` false.)  
- **Invalid traces**:  
  - `[a=⊤, b=⊥] → [a=⊥, b=⊥] → ...` ✗ (fails at second step: `a` false).  
  - `[a=⊤, b=⊥] → [a=⊤, b=⊤] → ...` ✗ (fails at second step: `b` true).  

#### Final Translation:  
> **"Globally, `a` must always be true and `b` must always be false for all time."**  

This phrase:  
- Accurately reflects the **perpetual requirement** (`G`),  
- Explicitly states **both constraints** (`a` maintained, `b` forbidden),  
- Emphasizes the **necessity of simultaneous compliance** at all times.
