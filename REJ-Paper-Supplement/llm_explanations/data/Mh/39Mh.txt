**Original LTL formula:**
`b U (d & a)`

---
**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**
1. **`d & a`** – Both `d` and `a` must be true *simultaneously* in a state.
2. **`b U (d & a)`** –
   - **Phase 1 (until condition):** `b` must hold in *every state* until the first state where `d & a` becomes true.
   - **Phase 2 (termination):** At the first state where `d & a` is true, the formula is satisfied, and `b` is no longer required to hold in subsequent states.
   - **Violation:** If `d & a` never becomes true *while `b` remains true*, the formula fails. If `b` becomes false *before* `d & a` holds, the formula also fails.

---
**Refined natural language phrasing:**
*"The system must eventually reach a state where both `d` and `a` are true, and until that moment, `b` must remain true in every intermediate state. Once `d` and `a` hold together, `b` is no longer constrained."*
