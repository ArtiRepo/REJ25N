**Original LTL formula:**
`!X !(w | x)`

---
**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**
1. `(w | x)`: Either `w` is true **or** `x` is true (or both) in the current state.
2. `!(w | x)`: **Neither** `w` **nor** `x` is true in the current state (both are false).
3. `X !(w | x)`: In the **very next state**, neither `w` nor `x` is true.
4. `!X !(w | x)`: It is **not the case** that, in the next state, both `w` and `x` are false.
   → Equivalently: In the next state, **at least one** of `w` or `x` **must be true**.

---
**Refined natural language phrasing:**
*"In the immediate next state, either `w` must hold, or `x` must hold (or both)."*

**Key clarifications:**
- **Constraint scope:** Only the next state is constrained; subsequent states are unrestricted.
- **Violation:** The formula fails if the next state has both `w` and `x` false.
- **Misunderstanding to avoid:** This is **not** a persistent requirement—it only applies to the single state following the current one. After that, `w` and `x` may behave arbitrarily.
