**Original LTL formula:**
`X t => X y`

---
**Rebuilding meaning:**
1. **`X t`**: "In the *very next state*, `t` must be true."
2. **`X y`**: "In the *very next state*, `y` must be true."
3. **`=>` (implication)**: The entire formula holds unless `X t` is true *and* `X y` is false.
   - If `X t` is **false** in the current state, the implication is **automatically satisfied** (no constraint on `y`).
   - If `X t` is **true** in the current state, then `X y` **must also be true** in that same next state.

---
**Refined natural language:**
*"If `t` becomes true in the very next state, then `y` must also become true in that same next state. Otherwise, there is no requirement on `y`."*

---
**Key clarifications:**
- **Constraint scope:** Only the *next state* is evaluated; future states beyond it are irrelevant.
- **Violation:** Occurs *only* if `t` is true in the next state *and* `y` is false there.
- **Misunderstanding to avoid:** The formula does *not* require `y` to stay true after the next state, nor does it link `t` and `y` in any other state. The implication is purely about their values in the *immediate next step*.
