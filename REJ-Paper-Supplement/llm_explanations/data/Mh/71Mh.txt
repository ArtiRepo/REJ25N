**Original LTL formula:**
`G(a ∧ !b)`

---
**Rebuilding meaning:**
1. **`!b`** → "b must be false in the current state."
2. **`a ∧ !b`** → "a must be true *and* b must be false in the current state."
3. **`G(a ∧ !b)`** → "In *every state* of the execution, a must hold *and* b must *never* hold."

---
**Refined natural language:**
*"The system must **always** satisfy two conditions simultaneously:
- **a** must be true in every state,
- **b** must remain false in every state.

**Constraints:**
- Violated *immediately* if, at any point, either `a` becomes false *or* `b` becomes true.
- No future state can relieve this requirement—it is a permanent invariant.

**Key distinction:**
This is *not* a one-time check (e.g., 'eventually') but an unconditional, ongoing obligation. The formula fails if *any* state violates `a ∧ !b`, even after infinite time."*
