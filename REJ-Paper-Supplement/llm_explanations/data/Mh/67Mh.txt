**Original LTL formula:**
`XXFa`

---
**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**
1. **`a`**: "a must be true in the current state."
2. **`Fa`**: "There must exist at least one future state where `a` is true."
3. **`X(Fa)`**: "In the *next* state, `Fa` must hold" → "From the next state onward, there must exist a future state where `a` is true."
4. **`XX(Fa)`**: "In the state *two steps ahead*, `Fa` must hold" → "From the state two steps ahead, there must exist a future state where `a` is true."

---
**Refined natural language phrasing:**
*"The system must guarantee that, **starting from the second next state**, there will eventually be a state where `a` holds.
**Constraints:**
- The current state and the immediate next state impose **no requirements** on `a`.
- The constraint activates **only from the second next state onward**, demanding that `a` must occur at least once in all possible futures from that point.
**Violation:** The formula fails if, from the second next state, `a` never becomes true in any subsequent state."*
