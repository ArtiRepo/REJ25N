**Original LTL Formula:**
`(b U c) & (d U !b)`

---

**Rebuilding Meaning:**
1. **`b U c`**:
   - *Phase 1 (until c becomes true):* `b` must hold in every state.
   - *Phase 2 (when c becomes true):* `c` must eventually occur, and once it does, `b` is no longer required.
   - *Violation:* If `c` never occurs, or if `b` fails before `c` appears.

2. **`d U !b`**:
   - *Phase 1 (until `!b` becomes true):* `d` must hold in every state.
   - *Phase 2 (when `!b` becomes true):* `!b` (i.e., `b` becomes false) must eventually occur, and once it does, `d` is no longer required.
   - *Violation:* If `!b` never occurs, or if `d` fails before `b` turns false.

3. **Conjunction (`&`):**
   Both `b U c` and `d U !b` must hold *simultaneously* along the same execution trace.

**Refined Natural Language Translation:**
*"The system must satisfy two concurrent conditions over time:
1. **First condition:** `b` must remain true in every state *until* `c` eventually becomes true (after which `b` is no longer constrained).
2. **Second condition:** `d` must remain true in every state *until* `b` eventually becomes false (after which `d` is no longer constrained).

**Key Constraints:**
- `c` *must* occur at some point (ensuring `b U c` terminates).
- `b` *must* eventually become false (ensuring `d U !b` terminates).
- Before these terminations:
  - `b` and `d` must *both* hold in every state (since their "until" phases overlap).
  - If either `b` or `d` fails before their respective termination condition (`c` or `!b`), the formula is violated.

**Violation Examples:**
- `c` never occurs (fails `b U c`).
- `b` never becomes false (fails `d U !b`).
- `b` or `d` drops prematurely (e.g., `d` fails while `b` is still true)."*

---
**Clarifications:**
- The overlap of `b` (from `b U c`) and `d` (from `d U !b`) creates a *temporary mutual dependency*: both must hold until their respective termination events.
- The formula does *not* constrain the system after `c` *and* `!b` have both occurred.
