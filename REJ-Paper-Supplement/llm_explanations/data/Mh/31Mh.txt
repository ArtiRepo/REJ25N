**Original LTL formula:**
`d & X (c U a)`

---

**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**
1. **`c U a`** (Until):
   - *"`a` must eventually become true, and until that moment, `c` must hold in every intervening state."*
   - Constraints:
     - **Active:** `c` must be true in all states *until* `a` first occurs.
     - **Termination:** When `a` becomes true, the constraint on `c` lifts, and the formula is satisfied.
     - **Violation:** If `a` never occurs *or* `c` fails before `a` appears, the formula is violated.

2. **`X (c U a)`** (Next):
   - *"The `c U a` constraint must begin to hold in the **very next state** (not necessarily now)."*
   - Constraints:
     - **Immediate:** No requirement on `c` or `a` in the *current* state.
     - **Ongoing:** From the next state onward, `c U a` applies as above.
     - **Violation:** If the next state fails to initiate `c U a` (e.g., `c` is false and `a` is false there), the formula is violated immediately.

3. **`d & X (c U a)`** (Conjunction):
   - *"**Now**, `d` must be true, **and** in the next state, `c U a` must start to hold."*
   - Constraints:
     - **Current state:** `d` must be true (unconditional).
     - **Next state onward:** `c U a` applies as above, independent of `d`’s future values.
     - **Violation:** Fails if either:
       - `d` is false now, *or*
       - The next state does not satisfy `c` (unless `a` is true there).

---

**Refined natural language translation:**
*"In the current state, `d` must hold. Additionally, in the **immediately following state**, `c` must start to hold continuously until `a` eventually becomes true (after which `c` is no longer required). The formula is violated if either `d` is false now, or if the next state does not begin the `c`-until-`a` sequence."*
