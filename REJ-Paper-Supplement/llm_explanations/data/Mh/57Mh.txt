**Original LTL formula:**
`F a ∧ G (a → X G !a)`

---

**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**
1. **`!a`**
   "a is false in the current state."

2. **`G !a`**
   "a must remain false in *all* future states (including the current one)."

3. **`X G !a`**
   "In the *very next state*, a must become false *and stay false forever*."

4. **`a → X G !a`**
   "If a is true now, then in the next state, a must become false *and stay false forever*."
   *(If a is false now, the implication imposes no constraint.)*

5. **`G (a → X G !a)`**
   "At *every point in time*, if a is true, then in the next state, a must become false *and stay false forever*."
   *(This enforces that a can only appear as the *last* occurrence in any infinite sequence.)*

6. **`F a`**
   "a must eventually be true at least once."

7. **`F a ∧ G (a → X G !a)`**
   "a must occur *exactly once* in the entire execution:
   - It must happen *eventually* (`F a`),
   - and once it does, it can *never* reappear (`G (a → X G !a)`)."

---

**Refined natural language:**
"The system must satisfy **a** *exactly once*:
- **a** must eventually hold (`F a`),
- and after the *first and only* occurrence of **a**, it must *never* hold again (`G (a → X G !a)`)."

---
**Key clarifications:**
- **Violating sequences:**
  - **a** never occurs (fails `F a`).
  - **a** occurs more than once (fails `G (a → X G !a)`).
- **Constraints cease:**
  The obligation `X G !a` only triggers *after* **a** occurs; before that, **a** may appear at any time (but only once).
- **Misunderstanding to avoid:**
  The formula does *not* require **a** to hold "forever after its first occurrence"—it requires **a** to *disappear forever* after its first occurrence.
