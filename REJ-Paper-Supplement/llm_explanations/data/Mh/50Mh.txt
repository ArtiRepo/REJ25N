**Original LTL formula:**
`F (o U u)`

---
**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**
1. **`o U u`** (Until):
   - *"`u` must eventually become true, and until that moment, `o` must hold in every intervening state."*
   - **Constraints:**
     - **Active:** `o` must be true in every state *until* `u` first occurs.
     - **Termination:** Once `u` becomes true, `o` is no longer required.
   - **Violation:** If `u` never occurs *or* `o` fails before `u` appears.

2. **`F (o U u)`** (Eventually):
   - *"There must exist at least one future state where `(o U u)` begins to hold."*
   - **Constraints:**
     - **Immediate:** No constraint now—only a guarantee that *somewhere ahead*, the `o U u` behavior will start.
     - **Ongoing:** Once `(o U u)` starts (i.e., `o` holds and `u` is pending), the Until constraints apply as above.
   - **Violation:** If the system reaches a state where `u` can *never* occur in the future (e.g., `!u` holds globally after some point), *or* if `o` fails before `u` appears in the relevant suffix.

---
**Refined natural language phrasing:**
*"At some future point, the system must enter a phase where:
- `u` eventually becomes true, and
- until `u` first occurs, `o` must remain true in every state.
Before this phase begins, no constraints apply; after it ends (when `u` is reached), no further constraints remain."*

---
**Key distinctions:**
- **Not immediate:** The formula does *not* require `o` or `u` to hold now—only that the `o U u` pattern will *eventually* start.
- **Local scope:** The `o` constraint is *temporary*, bound only to the interval where `u` is pending.
- **Violation cases:**
  - `u` never happens (e.g., `G !u`).
  - `o` fails before `u` appears *in the suffix where `o U u` is active*.
