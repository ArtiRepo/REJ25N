**Original LTL formula:**
`X b => !X d`

---
**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**
1. **`X b`**: "In the *very next state*, `b` must be true."
2. **`!X d`**: "In the *very next state*, `d` must **not** be true."
3. **Implication (`=>`)**:
   - If `X b` holds (i.e., `b` is true in the next state), then `!X d` *must* also hold (i.e., `d` must be false in that same next state).
   - If `X b` does **not** hold (i.e., `b` is false in the next state), the formula imposes **no constraint** on `d` in that state.

---
**Refined natural language translation:**
*"If `b` becomes true in the very next state, then `d` must **not** be true in that same next state. Otherwise, if `b` is false in the next state, the behavior of `d` is unrestricted."*

---
**Key clarifications:**
- **Constraint scope:** Only the *next state* is constrained, and only if `b` is true there.
- **Violation example:** A sequence where `b` is true in the next state **and** `d` is also true in that state violates the formula.
- **Non-violation examples:**
  - `b` is false in the next state (regardless of `d`).
  - `b` is true in the next state **and** `d` is false there.
