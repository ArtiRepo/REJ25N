**Original LTL formula:**
`X (y => x & w)`

---
**Rebuilding meaning:**
1. **Innermost (implication):** `y => x & w`
   - *"If y is true in a state, then both x and w must also be true in that same state."*
   - If `y` is false, the implication holds regardless of `x` or `w`.

2. **Next operator (X):** `X (y => x & w)`
   - The implication must hold **in the very next state** (not the current one).
   - No constraints are imposed on the current state or any state beyond the next.

---
**Refined natural language:**
*"In the immediate next state, if **y** holds, then both **x** and **w** must also hold in that same state. The current state and all subsequent states (after the next) are unconstrained by this formula."*

---
**Key clarifications:**
- **Satisfied if:**
  - Next state has `¬y` (implication vacuously true), **or**
  - Next state has `y` *and* both `x` and `w` true.
- **Violated if:**
  - Next state has `y` true but either `x` or `w` false.
- **Constraints cease:** After the next state, the formula imposes no further requirements.
