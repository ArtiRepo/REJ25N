**Original LTL formula:**
F !b

---
**Rebuild meaning from the bottom up:**
1. **!b** – "b is false in the current state."
2. **F(!b)** – "There exists at least one future state (including possibly the current state) where **b is false**."

---
**Refined natural language phrasing:**
*"At some point in the future (now or later), the system must reach a state where **b does not hold**. Before or after that point, **b may be true or false freely**—the formula imposes no other constraints."*

---
**Key clarifications:**
- **Satisfied if:** There’s at least one state in the execution where **b = false** (even if **b** is true elsewhere).
- **Violated if:** **b** is true in *every* state of the execution (i.e., **!b** never occurs).
- **Constraints cease:** Once **!b** is observed, the formula’s requirement is fulfilled; future values of **b** are irrelevant.
- **Misunderstanding to avoid:** The formula does *not* require **b** to stay false permanently—only that it becomes false *at least once*.
