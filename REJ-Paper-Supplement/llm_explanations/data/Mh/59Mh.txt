**Original LTL formula:**
`G((a ∧ Xa) → XX¬a)`

---

**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**
1. **`a ∧ Xa`**
   - *"a is true in the current state **and** a is also true in the very next state."*

2. **`XX¬a`**
   - *"a must be false in the state **two steps ahead** of the current one."*

3. **`(a ∧ Xa) → XX¬a`**
   - *"**If** a holds now and in the next state, **then** a must be false two states later."*
   - Equivalently: *"It is forbidden for a to hold in three consecutive states (now, next, and the one after)."*

4. **`G((a ∧ Xa) → XX¬a)`**
   - *"**At every point in time**, if a is true now and in the next state, then a must be false two states later."*
   - **Constraint scope:** The implication is checked continuously, but the prohibition on three consecutive `a`s applies *only* when the premise (`a ∧ Xa`) is met.

---

**Refined natural language phrasing:**
*"The system must never allow the variable **a** to hold true in **three consecutive states**. Whenever **a** is true in the current state and remains true in the immediate next state, it **must** become false in the state after that. This rule applies globally—at every moment in the execution."*

**Key clarifications:**
- **When constraints apply:** Only when `a` is true in two back-to-back states (triggering the implication).
- **When constraints cease:** After the second `a` in a row, the formula *demands* `¬a` in the third state but imposes no further requirements afterward.
- **Violating sequence:** `a, a, a` (three consecutive `a`s) violates the formula.
- **Satisfying sequences:**
  - `a, a, ¬a, ...` (complies after two `a`s).
  - `a, ¬a, a, ...` (never triggers the implication).
  - `¬a, ¬a, ¬a, ...` (trivially satisfies).
