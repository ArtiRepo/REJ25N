**Original LTL formula:**
`b | !X a`

---
**Rebuild meaning from the bottom up:**
1. `X a` – "a must be true in the very next state."
2. `!X a` – "a must **not** be true in the very next state."
3. `b | !X a` – "Either:
   - **b is true in the current state**, *or*
   - **a is false in the next state** (with no constraint on b)."

---
**Refined natural language phrasing:**
*"In the current state, either:*
- *b must hold, or*
- *a must **not** hold in the very next state.*

*The formula imposes no further constraints beyond these two conditions. It is satisfied immediately if either condition is met, and violated only if both fail (i.e., b is false now **and** a is true next)."*

---
**Key distinctions:**
- **Constraint scope:** Only the current state (for `b`) and the next state (for `a`) are constrained.
- **Violation case:** Requires *both* `!b` now **and** `a` next.
- **Misunderstanding to avoid:** The formula does *not* require `b` to hold forever or `a` to remain false indefinitely—only the specified immediate conditions.
