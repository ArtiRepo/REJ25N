**Original LTL formula:**
`(d U c) | (a U !c)`

---

**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**

1. **`d U c`**
   - *Phase 1:* `d` must hold in every state **until** `c` becomes true.
   - *Phase 2:* When `c` eventually occurs, `d` is no longer required.
   - *Constraint:* Fails if `c` never holds *or* if `d` fails before `c` appears.

2. **`a U !c`**
   - *Phase 1:* `a` must hold in every state **until** `c` becomes false (i.e., `!c` becomes true).
   - *Phase 2:* Once `!c` occurs (i.e., `c` is false), `a` is no longer required.
   - *Constraint:* Fails if `c` remains true forever *or* if `a` fails before `c` turns false.

3. **Disjunction (`|`)**
   - *Either* the first scenario (`d U c`) **or** the second scenario (`a U !c`) must hold.
   - No requirement for both; the system satisfies the formula if it complies with at least one branch.

**Refined natural language translation:**
*"The system must satisfy **one** of the following two behaviors over time:
1. **Either** `c` eventually becomes true, with `d` holding continuously until that moment,
2. **Or** `c` eventually becomes false, with `a` holding continuously until that moment.

The formula imposes no constraints *after* `c`’s truth value resolves (true *or* false). It fails only if:
- Neither `c` nor `!c` ever occurs (i.e., `c`’s value never changes from its initial state),
- *Or* the required condition (`d` or `a`) is violated before `c`’s resolution."*
