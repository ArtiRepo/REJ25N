**Original LTL formula:**
G(a ∨ b)

---
**Rebuild meaning from the bottom up:**
1. **(a ∨ b):** In any given state, *either* **a** is true, *or* **b** is true (or both).
2. **G(a ∨ b):** The above condition must hold **in every state** of the execution, without exception.

---
**Refined natural language phrasing:**
*"At every point in time, **a** must hold, or **b** must hold (or both). The system is never allowed to reach a state where neither **a** nor **b** is true."*

---
**Key clarifications:**
- **Constraint scope:** The formula imposes a **persistent** requirement—there is no "release" condition where the constraint lifts.
- **Violation:** A single state where both **a** and **b** are false invalidates the entire formula, regardless of past or future states.
- **Misunderstanding to avoid:** This is *not* a "eventually" condition (e.g., "a or b will happen at some point"). It demands **continuous** satisfaction.
