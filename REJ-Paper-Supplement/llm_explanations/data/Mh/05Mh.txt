**Original LTL formula:**
`X a & b`

---
**Rebuilding meaning:**
1. **`a & b`** (conjunction):
   - *Current state*: Both `a` and `b` must hold simultaneously.
   - *Constraint*: Immediate; no temporal extension.

2. **`X a`** (next):
   - *Next state*: `a` must hold in the state immediately following the current one.
   - *Constraint*: Only applies to the next state; current state is unconstrained by `X a`.

3. **Combined (`X a & b`)**:
   - *Current state*: `b` must hold **now**.
   - *Next state*: `a` must hold **in the next step**.
   - *No further constraints* beyond these two conditions.

---
**Refined natural language:**
*"In the current state, `b` must be true, **and** in the very next state, `a` must be true. The formula imposes no other constraints—neither before nor after these two states."*

---
**Key distinctions:**
- **Violation examples:**
  - Current state: `!b` (fails immediately).
  - Next state: `!a` (fails if `b` held initially).
- **Non-constraints:**
  - `a` in the current state is irrelevant.
  - `b` in the next state is unconstrained.
- **Misunderstanding to avoid:**
  The formula does *not* require `a` to hold in the current state or `b` to persist beyond now. The constraints are strictly localized to `(b now) → (a next)`.
