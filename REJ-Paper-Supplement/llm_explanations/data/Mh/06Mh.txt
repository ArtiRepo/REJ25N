**Original LTL formula:**
`X !b & d`

---
**Rebuilding meaning:**
1. `!b` – "b is false in the current state."
2. `X !b` – "In the *very next state*, b must be false."
3. `d` – "d is true in the *current state*."
4. `X !b & d` – Combines the two: "d must hold *now*, and in the *immediately following state*, b must be false."

---
**Refined natural language:**
*"At the current moment, d must be true, and in the very next state, b must be false. No constraints apply beyond that next state."*

**Key distinctions:**
- **Immediate constraint:** `d` must hold *now*.
- **One-step constraint:** `b` must be false *only in the next state*—afterward, `b` may be true or false without violating the formula.
- **Violation examples:**
  - If `d` is false now, the formula fails immediately.
  - If `b` is true in the next state, the formula fails at that step.
- **Non-constraints:** The formula does not require `d` to hold in future states or `b` to remain false after the next state.
