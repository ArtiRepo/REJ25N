**Original LTL formula:**
G a

**Rebuild meaning:**
- The operator **G** ("globally") imposes a constraint on **a** across *all* states in the execution trace.
- **a** must hold *immediately* in the current state and *persistently* in every subsequent state.

**Refined natural language:**
*"a must be true in the current state and remain true in every future state, without exception."*

---
**Key distinctions:**
- **Constraint scope:** Applies to *all* states (now and forever).
- **Violation:** Fails *immediately* if **a** is false in *any* state (current or future).
- **Misunderstanding to avoid:** G a does *not* mean "a will *eventually* always hold"—it demands *uninterrupted* truth from the start.
