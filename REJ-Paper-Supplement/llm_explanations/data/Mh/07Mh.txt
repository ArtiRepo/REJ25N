**Original LTL formula:**
`a U c`

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom up:**
- The *until* operator (`U`) splits behavior into two phases:
  1. **Phase 1 (persistent constraint):** `a` must hold in *every state* until `c` becomes true.
  2. **Phase 2 (termination):** `c` must eventually occur. Once `c` is true, `a` is no longer required.

**Refined natural language phrasing:**
*"`c` must eventually become true, and until that moment, `a` must remain true in every intermediate state. After `c` occurs, `a`’s truth value no longer matters."*

---
**Key clarifications:**
- **Satisfied if:** A trace has a state where `c` holds, and all prior states satisfy `a`.
- **Violated if:** Either `c` never occurs, *or* `a` fails before `c` does.
- **Constraints cease:** The instant `c` becomes true—`a` is no longer enforced.
- **Misunderstanding to avoid:** `a U c` does *not* require `a` to hold *forever*—only until `c`’s first occurrence.
