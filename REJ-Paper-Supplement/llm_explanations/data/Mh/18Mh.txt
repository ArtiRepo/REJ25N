**Original LTL formula:**
`!F (a & b)`

**Rebuilding meaning:**
1. `(a & b)` – Both *a* and *b* must be true in the same state.
2. `F (a & b)` – There exists at least one future state where *a* and *b* are simultaneously true.
3. `!F (a & b)` – Negation of the above: **In no future state (including the current one) do *a* and *b* hold together.**

**Refined natural language:**
*"At no point in the execution—now or ever—may *a* and *b* be true at the same time."*

**Key implications:**
- **Constraint:** Permanently forbids any state where *a* and *b* overlap.
- **Violation:** Occurs the instant *a* and *b* coincide in any state.
- **Non-constraint:** If *a* and *b* never align, the formula is trivially satisfied.
- **Misunderstanding to avoid:** This is *stronger* than `G !(a & b)`—it rules out even transient overlaps, not just persistent ones.
