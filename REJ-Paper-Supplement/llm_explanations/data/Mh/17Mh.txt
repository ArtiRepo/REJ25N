- **Original LTL formula:** `!G c`

- **Rebuild meaning:**
  - `G c` means *"c must hold in every state of the execution."*
  - `!G c` negates this, so the constraint is reversed: *"It is not the case that c holds in every state."*

- **Refined natural language phrasing:**
  *"There must exist at least one state (now or in the future) where **c is false**."*
  **Constraints:**
  - **No immediate requirement** on `c` in the current state (it may hold or fail now).
  - **Ongoing obligation:** The system must eventually reach a state where `c` fails—otherwise, the formula is violated.
  **Violation occurs if:** `c` remains true indefinitely.
  **Key distinction:** Unlike `F !c`, this does not require `!c` to *eventually become permanently true*—only that `!c` occurs at least once.
