**Original LTL formula:**
G (n => s)

---
**Rebuilding meaning:**
1. **Implication (n => s):**
   - *"If n is true in the current state, then s must also be true in that same state."*
   - If *n* is false, the implication imposes **no constraint** on *s* (it may be true or false).
   - If *n* is true, *s* **must** be true; otherwise, the implication fails.

2. **Globally (G):**
   - The implication *(n => s)* must hold **in every state** of the execution, without exception.
   - **Constraints apply continuously:** At no point can *n* be true while *s* is false.

---
**Refined natural language:**
*"In every state of the system, whenever **n** holds, **s** must also hold simultaneously. The formula does not restrict **s** when **n** is false, but it permanently forbids any state where **n** is true and **s** is false."*

---
**Key clarifications:**
- **Satisfied if:** For all states, *n* being true never occurs without *s* also being true.
- **Violated if:** At least one state exists where *n* is true and *s* is false.
- **Misunderstanding to avoid:** The formula does **not** require *s* to be true when *n* is false—only that *s* "follows" *n* when *n* occurs.
