**Original LTL formula:**
`Fa → Gb`

---
**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**
1. **`b`**: "b must be true in the current state."
2. **`Gb`**: "b must be true in *every* state from the current state onward."
3. **`Fa`**: "There exists at least one future state (including the current state) where `a` is true."
4. **`Fa → Gb`**:
   - If `Fa` is true (i.e., `a` holds at some point now or later), then `Gb` must hold *from the start of the trace*.
   - If `Fa` is false (i.e., `a` never holds), the formula imposes *no constraints* on `b`.

---
**Refined natural language phrasing:**
*"If `a` ever becomes true at any point (now or in the future), then `b` must have been true continuously from the very beginning of the execution and must remain true forever. If `a` never becomes true, `b` is unconstrained."*

---
**Key clarifications:**
- **Constraint timing**: The obligation `Gb` is *retroactive*—it must hold from the first state, not just after `a` occurs.
- **Violation**: The formula fails if `a` occurs *at any time* and `b` was false *earlier* or becomes false *later*.
- **Non-imposition**: If `a` never occurs, `b`’s behavior is irrelevant.
