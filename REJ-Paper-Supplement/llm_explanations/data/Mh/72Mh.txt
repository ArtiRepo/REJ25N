**Original LTL formula:**
G !a

**Rebuilding meaning:**
1. **!a** → "a is false in the current state."
2. **G(!a)** → "In every state of the execution, a must be false."

**Refined natural language:**
"The system must **never** allow *a* to be true at any point in time—*a* must remain false in every state, without exception."

*(Violation: If *a* becomes true even once, the formula fails immediately and permanently.)*
