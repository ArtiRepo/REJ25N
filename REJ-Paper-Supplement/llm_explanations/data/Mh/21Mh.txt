**Original LTL formula:**
`X (t & y)`

---
**Rebuilding meaning:**
1. **`t & y`** → Both `t` *and* `y` must be true **in the same state**.
2. **`X (t & y)`** → The conjunction `(t & y)` must hold **in the very next state** (i.e., the state immediately following the current one).

---
**Refined natural language:**
*"In the next state, both **t** and **y** must be true simultaneously."*

---
**Key clarifications:**
- **Constraint timing:** The formula imposes **no requirement** on the current state—only the next one.
- **Violation:** Fails if *either* `t` *or* `y` is false in the next state (even if one holds).
- **After next state:** No further constraints; the formula’s truth is determined solely by the next state’s values.
