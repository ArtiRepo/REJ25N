**Original LTL formula:**
`X (!i) | X (j)`

---
**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**
1. `!i` – "i is false in the current state."
2. `X (!i)` – "In the **very next state**, i must be false."
3. `X (j)` – "In the **very next state**, j must be true."
4. `|` (OR) – "At least one of the two must hold in the next state."

---
**Refined natural language translation:**
*"In the immediate next state, either:*
- *i must be false, **or**
- *j must be true.

*The formula imposes no constraints beyond the next state. After that, the behavior of i and j is unrestricted."*

---
**Key clarifications:**
- **Satisfied if:** The next state meets *either* condition (even if both do).
- **Violated if:** The next state has `i = true` **and** `j = false`.
- **Misunderstanding to avoid:** The formula does *not* require both conditions to hold simultaneously—only one suffices. Constraints vanish after the next state.
