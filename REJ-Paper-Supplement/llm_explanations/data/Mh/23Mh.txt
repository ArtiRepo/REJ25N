**Original LTL formula:**
`t => w`

---
**Rebuilding meaning:**
1. **`=>` (implies)** is a logical operator that evaluates to *false* only when the left operand (`t`) is *true* and the right operand (`w`) is *false*. Otherwise, it is *true*.
2. **`t` and `w`** are atomic propositions (state variables) with no temporal constraints—they refer only to the *current state* when evaluated.
3. The formula does **not** impose constraints on future or past states; it is purely a condition on the present.

---
**Refined natural language:**
*"If **t** holds in the current state, then **w** must also hold in that same state. If **t** is false, the formula imposes no requirements on **w**."*

---
**Key clarifications:**
- **Satisfied when:**
  - `t` is false (regardless of `w`), **or**
  - Both `t` and `w` are true.
- **Violated when:**
  - `t` is true **and** `w` is false.
- **No temporal persistence:** The constraint applies *only* to the instant it is checked. Future or past states are irrelevant.
