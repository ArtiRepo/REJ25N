**Original LTL formula:**
`XXFXa`

---
**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**
1. **`a`** → "a must be true in the current state."
2. **`Xa`** → "a must be true in the *next* state."
3. **`FXa`** → "There must exist *some future state* where `Xa` holds (i.e., `a` is true in the state *after* that future state)."
   - Equivalently: "At some point, the *next* state must satisfy `a`."
4. **`X(FXa)`** → "In the *next* state, `FXa` must hold (i.e., from that next state onward, there must eventually be a state where `a` is true in its successor)."
5. **`XX(FXa)`** → "In the state *two steps ahead*, `FXa` must hold (i.e., from that point forward, there must eventually be a state where `a` is true in its successor)."

**Refined natural language translation:**
*"Two states from now, there must eventually exist a state where `a` holds in the very next state after it."*

---
**Key clarifications:**
- **Constraints apply:**
  - The formula imposes *no requirements* on the current state or the next state.
  - Only from the *second future state* onward must there exist a later state where `a` is true in its immediate successor.
- **Violation occurs if:**
  - After the second state, the system reaches a point where `a` is *never* true in any subsequent next state (e.g., `a` remains false forever from some point).
- **Misunderstanding to avoid:**
  - This is *not* equivalent to `FXXa` (which requires `a` to hold *two states after some future point*). Here, `a` must hold *one state after* some future point, but this guarantee only kicks in *two states from now*.
