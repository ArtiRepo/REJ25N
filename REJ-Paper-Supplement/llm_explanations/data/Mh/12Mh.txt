**Original LTL formula:**
`b U (a | d)`

---
**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**
1. **`(a | d)`** – Either `a` is true **or** `d` is true (or both) in the current state.
2. **`b U (a | d)`** – The formula requires that:
   - **Eventually**, `(a | d)` must become true (at least once in the future).
   - **Until that moment**, `b` must hold in *every* intervening state.
   - Once `(a | d)` becomes true, `b` is no longer constrained.

---
**Refined natural language translation:**
*"The system must eventually reach a state where either `a` or `d` holds. Until that point, `b` must remain true continuously. After `(a | d)` first occurs, `b` may behave arbitrarily (true or false) in all subsequent states."*

---
**Key clarifications:**
- **Constraint scope:** `b` is *only* enforced **before** `(a | d)` first becomes true.
- **Termination:** The formula is satisfied *immediately* if `(a | d)` is true in the current state (regardless of `b`).
- **Violation examples:**
  - If `b` becomes false *before* `(a | d)` ever holds → violation.
  - If `(a | d)` *never* holds → violation (even if `b` stays true forever).
- **Misunderstanding to avoid:** `b` is *not* required after `(a | d)` first occurs.
