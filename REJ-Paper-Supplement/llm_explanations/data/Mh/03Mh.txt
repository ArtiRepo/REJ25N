**Original LTL formula:**
*a & X b*

---
**Rebuilding meaning:**
1. **X b** – "In the **very next state**, *b* must hold."
2. **a** – "*a* must hold **in the current state**."
3. **&** – Both conditions must be true **simultaneously at the moment of evaluation**.

---
**Refined natural language:**
"*a* must be true **now**, and in the **immediately following state**, *b* must become true.

- **Constraints:**
  - *a* is constrained **only in the current state** (no further requirements).
  - *b* is constrained **only in the next state** (no requirements before or after).
- **Violation occurs if:**
  - *a* is false now, **or**
  - *b* is false in the next state.
- **After the next state**, the formula imposes **no further constraints**.
