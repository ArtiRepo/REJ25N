**Original LTL formula:**
`F (!y & w)`

---
**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**
1. `!y`: "y must be false in the current state."
2. `!y & w`: "y must be false **and** w must be true in the current state."
3. `F (!y & w)`: "There must exist at least one **future state** where y is false and w is true."

---
**Refined natural language phrasing:**
*"At some point in the future, the system must reach a state where **y is false** and **w is true simultaneously**. Before or after that moment, the values of y and w are unconstrained by this formula."*

---
**Key clarifications:**
- **Satisfied if:** There exists at least one future state where `!y ∧ w` holds (even if briefly).
- **Violated if:** In *every* possible future state, either `y` is true **or** `w` is false.
- **Constraints cease:** After the `!y ∧ w` condition is met, the formula imposes no further requirements.
- **Misunderstanding to avoid:** The formula does *not* require `!y ∧ w` to hold forever—only that it occurs at least once.
