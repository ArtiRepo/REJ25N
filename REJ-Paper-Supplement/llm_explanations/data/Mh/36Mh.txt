**Original LTL formula:**
G (j => !f)

---
**Rebuilding meaning:**
1. **Implication (j => !f):**
   - *"If j is true in the current state, then f must be false in that same state."*
   - When **j is false**, the implication holds regardless of **f** (no constraint on **f**).
   - When **j is true**, **f** is forced to be false (constraint applies).

2. **Globally (G):**
   - The implication must hold *in every state* of the execution.
   - At no point can **j** be true while **f** is also true.

---
**Refined natural language:**
*"In every state of the system, whenever **j** is true, **f** must simultaneously be false. There are no restrictions on **f** when **j** is false."*

---
**Key distinctions:**
- **Constraint applies:** Only in states where **j** holds.
- **Constraint ceases:** Immediately when **j** becomes false (or remains false).
- **Violation:** Any state where **j ∧ f** is true invalidates the formula.
- **Misunderstanding to avoid:** The formula does *not* require **f** to be false *always*—only when **j** is true. **f** may freely fluctuate when **j** is false.
