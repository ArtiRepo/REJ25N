**Original LTL formula:**
`a U (c & d)`

---
**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**
1. **`c & d`** – Both `c` and `d` must hold simultaneously in a single state.
2. **`a U (c & d)`** –
   - **Phase 1 (until condition):** `a` must hold in *every state* until the first state where `c & d` becomes true.
   - **Phase 2 (termination):** At some future state, `c & d` *must* become true. Once this occurs, `a` is no longer required to hold in subsequent states.

---
**Refined natural language translation:**
*"The system must eventually reach a state where both `c` and `d` are true simultaneously. Until that moment arrives, `a` must remain true in every intermediate state. After `c & d` becomes true, `a` imposes no further constraints."*

---
**Key clarifications:**
- **Satisfied if:**
  - `a` holds continuously until a state where `c ∧ d` is true (e.g., sequence: `a, a, a, (c ∧ d), ...`).
  - `c ∧ d` may hold immediately (e.g., first state satisfies `c ∧ d`; `a` is irrelevant afterward).
- **Violated if:**
  - `a` fails *before* `c ∧ d` ever becomes true (e.g., `a, a, ¬a, ...` with no `c ∧ d` later).
  - `c ∧ d` *never* becomes true (e.g., infinite `a` states without `c ∧ d`).
- **Misunderstanding to avoid:**
  - `a` is *not* required *after* `c ∧ d` becomes true—only *until* that point. The formula does not constrain the system beyond the first occurrence of `c ∧ d`.
