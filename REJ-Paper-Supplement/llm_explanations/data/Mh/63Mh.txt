**Original LTL formula:**
`XXXa`

---
**Rebuild meaning from the bottom up:**
1. Start with `a`: *"a must be true in the current state."*
2. Apply the first `X`: *"a must be true in the **next** state (relative to the current evaluation point)."*
3. Apply the second `X`: *"a must be true in the **state after the next** (i.e., two steps ahead)."*
4. Apply the third `X`: *"a must be true in the **third future state** (three steps ahead)."*

---
**Refined natural language:**
*"In the state that occurs **three steps from now**, `a` must hold. The formula imposes **no constraints** on `a` in the current state or the two intervening states—only the third future state is checked."*

---
**Key clarifications:**
- **Satisfied if:** The third future state (counting from now) makes `a` true, regardless of `a`’s value in earlier states.
- **Violated if:** The third future state makes `a` false.
- **Misunderstanding to avoid:** The formula does *not* require `a` to hold continuously or in intermediate steps—only at the exact third future state. If the trace ends before three steps, the formula is **false** (no third state exists to satisfy it).
