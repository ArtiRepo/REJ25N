**Original LTL formula:**
`(c U a) & (b U a)`

---

**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**
1. **`c U a`**:
   - *"`a` must eventually become true, and until that moment, `c` must hold in every state."*
   - Constraints:
     - **Ongoing**: `c` must remain true in all states *until* `a` first occurs.
     - **Termination**: Once `a` becomes true, `c` is no longer required.
   - Violation: If `a` never occurs *or* `c` fails before `a` does.

2. **`b U a`**:
   - *"`a` must eventually become true, and until that moment, `b` must hold in every state."*
   - Constraints mirror `c U a`, but with `b` instead of `c`.

3. **`&` (conjunction)**:
   - *"Both `c U a` and `b U a` must hold simultaneously."*
   - Implies:
     - `a` must eventually occur (shared by both operands).
     - Until `a` occurs, *both* `b` and `c` must hold in every state.

---

**Refined natural language translation:**
*"The system must eventually reach a state where `a` is true. Until that point, **both** `b` and `c` must remain true in every intermediate state. Once `a` becomes true, neither `b` nor `c` is required thereafter."*

---
**Key clarifications:**
- **Constraints apply**: Only *before* `a` first occurs (both `b` and `c` must hold).
- **Constraints cease**: Permanently when `a` becomes true (even if later states falsify `b` or `c`).
- **Violation cases**:
  - `a` never occurs.
  - Either `b` or `c` fails *before* `a` occurs.
- **Misunderstanding to avoid**: The formula does *not* require `b` or `c` to hold *after* `a` appears. Their obligation is strictly pre-`a`.
