**Original LTL formula:**
`(c & b) U a`

---
**Rebuilding meaning:**
1. **`c & b`** – Both `c` and `b` must hold *simultaneously* in the current state.
2. **`U a`** – The **Until** operator splits behavior into two phases:
   - **Phase 1 (constraint active):** `(c & b)` must hold in *every state* until `a` becomes true.
   - **Phase 2 (constraint lifted):** Once `a` becomes true, `(c & b)` is no longer required in subsequent states.
   - **Termination requirement:** `a` *must* eventually become true; if it never does, the formula is violated.

---
**Refined natural language:**
*"The system must maintain both `c` and `b` in every state **until** `a` becomes true. At the moment `a` holds, the requirement on `c` and `b` ends, but `a` must occur eventually—failing to ever reach `a` violates the formula."*

---
**Key clarifications:**
- **Immediate constraint:** If `(c & b)` is false in the *first state*, the formula fails immediately (unless `a` is already true).
- **Ongoing constraint:** `(c & b)` must persist *only* in states where `a` hasn’t yet occurred.
- **Violation cases:**
  - `(c & b)` fails *before* `a` appears.
  - `a` *never* appears in the execution.
- **Misunderstanding to avoid:** The formula does *not* require `(c & b)` to hold *after* `a` becomes true.
