**Original LTL formula:**
`X(!g | !j)`

---
**Rebuilding meaning:**
1. **`!g`** → "g is false in the current state."
2. **`!j`** → "j is false in the current state."
3. **`(!g | !j)`** → "Either g is false **or** j is false (or both) in the current state."
4. **`X(!g | !j)`** → "In the **very next state**, either g must be false or j must be false (or both)."

---
**Refined natural language:**
*"In the immediate next state, at least one of the following must hold: g is false, or j is false. The formula imposes no constraints beyond that single next state."*
