**Original LTL formula:**
`G (!i) | F (f U i)`

---

**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**
1. **`!i`**
   *"i is false in the current state."*

2. **`G (!i)`**
   *"i must remain false in every state of the execution (globally)."*
   - **Constraint:** Permanently forbids `i` from ever becoming true.
   - **Violation:** Any state where `i` holds invalidates the formula.

3. **`f U i`**
   *"i must eventually become true, and until then, f must hold in every intermediate state."*
   - **Constraint:**
     - `f` must stay true *until* `i` first occurs.
     - Once `i` becomes true, `f` is no longer required.
   - **Violation:**
     - If `i` never occurs, or
     - `f` fails before `i` first occurs.

4. **`F (f U i)`**
   *"There must exist at least one future state where `(f U i)` begins to hold."*
   - **Constraint:**
     - The system may freely evolve until `(f U i)` starts.
     - Once `(f U i)` is triggered, the above constraints apply.
   - **Violation:** If `(f U i)` never starts (i.e., no future state satisfies `f` leading to `i`).

5. **`G (!i) | F (f U i)`** (disjunction)
   *"Either:
   - **Option 1:** `i` never occurs in the entire execution (**G (!i)**), *or*
   - **Option 2:** At some future point, the system enters a phase where `f` holds until `i` eventually occurs (**F (f U i)**)."*
   - **Constraint:**
     - If `i` never appears, no further constraints apply beyond `!i`.
     - If `i` *does* appear, the system must eventually satisfy `f U i` (i.e., `f` must lead to `i`).
   - **Violation:**
     - `i` appears *without* ever satisfying `F (f U i)` (e.g., `i` occurs abruptly after `!f`).
     - Neither `G (!i)` nor `F (f U i)` holds (e.g., `i` occurs once but `f` was never true before it).

---
**Refined natural language phrasing:**
*"The system must satisfy one of two behaviors:
1. **Permanent absence:** The property `i` never holds in any state, *or*
2. **Conditional preparation:** If `i` ever occurs, there must be a prior state where `f` starts holding continuously until `i` finally becomes true.

In other words, `i` is either *always avoided* or *properly anticipated* by `f`."*

---
**Key distinctions:**
- **Immediate vs. ongoing:**
  - `G (!i)` is checked globally from the start.
  - `F (f U i)` imposes no constraints until `(f U i)` is triggered.
- **Constraints cease:**
  - For `f U i`, `f` is only required *until* `i` first occurs.
- **Misunderstanding risk:**
  - The formula does *not* require `f` to hold *forever*—only until `i` appears.
  - `i` may occur *without* `f` if `G (!i)` is the chosen path (i.e., `i` never occurs).
