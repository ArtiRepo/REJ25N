**Original LTL formula:**
`Xa U Xb`

---
**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**
1. **`Xa`**: "a must be true in the *next* state."
2. **`Xb`**: "b must be true in the *next* state."
3. **`Xa U Xb`**:
   - **Phase 1 (Until condition)**: "In every state *until* the state where `Xb` holds, `Xa` must hold in the *next* state."
   - **Phase 2 (Termination)**: "`Xb` must eventually become true in some future state (i.e., `b` must hold in the state *after* that)."
   - **Constraint release**: Once `Xb` is satisfied (i.e., `b` is true in the next state), `Xa` is no longer required.

---
**Refined natural language translation:**
*"In every state along the execution, the following must hold:
- The **next** state must satisfy `a` (*immediate constraint*), **until** a state is reached where the **next** state satisfies `b`.
- At that point (`Xb` becomes true), the requirement for `Xa` terminates, and `b` must hold in the subsequent state.
- **Violation occurs** if either:
  - `Xa` fails in any next state before `Xb` is reached, **or**
  - `Xb` never becomes true (i.e., `b` never holds in any next state)."*

---
**Key clarifications:**
- The formula **does not** constrain the *current* state—only the *next* state onward.
- "Until" binds to the *next-state* truth of `a` and `b`, not their current values.
- Misunderstanding to avoid: `Xa U Xb` ≠ "a holds until b holds in the *current* state." The `X` operators shift constraints forward by one step.
