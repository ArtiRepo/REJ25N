### **Original LTL Formula:**
**G (!i) | F (f U i)**

---

### **Parsing Tree Breakdown:**
The formula is a disjunction (**|**) of two subformulas:
1. **G (!i)**
   - **!i**: Negation of proposition **i** ("**i** is not true").
   - **G (!i)**: Globally (always), "**i** is never true" (i.e., **i** is false in every state of the trace).

2. **F (f U i)**
   - **f U i**: "Until" operator – "**f** holds *until* **i** becomes true" (i.e., **f** must remain true in every state until **i** eventually occurs).
   - **F (f U i)**: Eventually (at some future point), the "until" condition (**f U i**) must hold.

The entire formula is the **OR** of these two subformulas.

### **Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up:**

1. **G (!i)**:
   - "For all future states, **i** is never true."
   - This imposes a **strong constraint**: The system must **permanently avoid** **i**.

2. **F (f U i)**:
   - "At some point in the future, there exists a state where **f U i** holds."
   - Breaking down **f U i**:
     - "**f** must hold continuously *until* **i** becomes true."
     - This means:
       - **i** must eventually occur (termination condition for the "until").
       - Until **i** occurs, **f** must remain true in every intermediate state.
   - So, **F (f U i)** means:
     - "Eventually, **i** will happen, and until then, **f** must always hold."

3. **Combining with OR (|)**:
   - The system must satisfy **either**:
     - **G (!i)**: **i** never happens (and **f** is irrelevant), **or**
     - **F (f U i)**: **i** eventually happens, with **f** holding until then.

### **Refined Natural Language Translation:**
**"The system must satisfy one of the following two behaviors over time:**
1. **i never occurs at any point in the future** (i.e., **i** is permanently false), **or**
2. **i eventually occurs, and until that moment, f must continuously hold true.**"**

---
### **When Is the Formula Satisfied?**
- **Case 1 (G (!i))**:
  - The trace **never** contains **i** (e.g., **i** is a "bad state" that must be avoided forever).
  - Example: In a traffic light system, **i** = "collision," and the formula requires that a collision never happens.

- **Case 2 (F (f U i))**:
  - The trace **must** eventually reach **i**, and **f** must hold in every state leading up to **i**.
  - Example: In a vending machine, **i** = "item dispensed," and **f** = "payment confirmed." The formula requires that either:
    - The item is never dispensed (e.g., no request is made), **or**
    - If the item is eventually dispensed, payment must be confirmed at every step until then.

---
### **Key Constraints Imposed on the System:**
1. **Avoidance or Guarantee**:
   - The system can **either** avoid **i** entirely **or** ensure that **i** happens with **f** as a precondition.
2. **Temporal Flexibility**:
   - If **i** never happens, **f**’s truth is irrelevant (the first disjunct is satisfied).
   - If **i** does happen, **f** must be maintained until then (the second disjunct kicks in).
3. **No "Partial" Satisfaction**:
   - The formula is **not** satisfied if **i** occurs without **f** holding beforehand (violates **F (f U i)**) **and** **i** also occurs somewhere else (violates **G (!i)**).

---
### **Alternative Phrasing (More Concise):**
**"The system must ensure that either:**
- **i** never happens, **or**
- **i** happens eventually, but only after **f** has held continuously since the present moment.**"**

This captures the **dual nature** of the formula: a choice between permanent avoidance or conditional eventuality.
