### **Original LTL Formula:**
**X(!g ∨ !j)**

---

### **Parsing Tree Breakdown:**
The formula can be broken down as follows:

1. **Atomic Propositions:**
   - `g` (some proposition, e.g., "the system is in state *g*")
   - `j` (some proposition, e.g., "the system is in state *j*")

2. **Negations:**
   - `!g` (negation: "the system is **not** in state *g*")
   - `!j` (negation: "the system is **not** in state *j*")

3. **Disjunction (OR):**
   - `!g ∨ !j` ("the system is **not in *g*** **or** it is **not in *j***")

4. **Next-Time Operator (X):**
   - `X(!g ∨ !j)` ("**In the next step**, it will be the case that the system is not in *g* or not in *j*"")

---

### **Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up:**

1. **Innermost Level (Negations):**
   - `!g` means "*g* does not hold in the current state."
   - `!j` means "*j* does not hold in the current state."

2. **Disjunction (`∨`):**
   - `!g ∨ !j` means:
     - *Either* `!g` is true (so *g* is false),
     - *Or* `!j` is true (so *j* is false),
     - *Or both* are true.
   - This is logically equivalent to the **negation of the conjunction** (`!(g ∧ j)`), meaning:
     - "*It is not the case that both *g* and *j* hold simultaneously.*"

3. **Next-Time Operator (`X`):**
   - `X(φ)` means that the subformula `φ` must hold **in the very next state** (time step) of the system.
   - So, `X(!g ∨ !j)` means:
     - "*In the next state, it will be true that either *g* does not hold or *j* does not hold (or neither holds).*"

### **Refined Natural Language Translation:**
**Formal Meaning:**
*"In the next time step, the system must **not** be in a state where both *g* and *j* are true simultaneously. In other words, at least one of *g* or *j* must be false in the next state."*

**Alternative Phrasings (depending on context):**
- *"The system must ensure that, in the next step, *g* and *j* are not both active at the same time."*
- *"After the current moment, the system cannot be in a state where *g* and *j* coexist."*
- *"The next state must exclude the scenario where *g* and *j* are both true."*

---

### **When is the Formula Satisfied?**
The formula `X(!g ∨ !j)` is satisfied in a trace (sequence of states) if:
- **In the state *immediately following* the current one**, at least one of the following is true:
  - `g` is false, **or**
  - `j` is false.

**Violation Occurs When:**
- In the next state, **both `g` and `j` are true** (i.e., the system enters a state where `g ∧ j` holds).

---

### **Example Scenario (if *g* and *j* are concrete):**
Suppose:
- `g` = "the green light is on,"
- `j` = "the pedestrian crossing signal is active."

Then `X(!g ∨ !j)` means:
*"In the next time step, the green light and pedestrian crossing signal **must not both be on simultaneously** (at least one must be off)."*

This could represent a safety constraint in a traffic light system.
