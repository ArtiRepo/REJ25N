### **Original LTL Formula:**
**G(a → Fb)**

---

### **Parsing Tree Breakdown:**
The formula can be decomposed as follows:

1. **Innermost subformula:**
   **Fb** (eventually *b*)
   - Meaning: *"b must hold at some future point in time."*

2. **Implication inside the global operator:**
   **(a → Fb)**
   - Meaning: *"Whenever a holds, then eventually b must hold."*

3. **Global (temporal) operator:**
   **G(a → Fb)**
   - Meaning: *"For all future time points, the implication (a → Fb) must hold."*

---

### **Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up:**

1. **Fb** means that *b* must occur at least once in the future.
2. **a → Fb** means that *if a is true now*, then *b must eventually become true*.
   - If *a* is false, the implication is vacuously satisfied (no constraint).
3. **G(a → Fb)** means that *this implication must hold at every point in time*.
   - In other words, *whenever a occurs at any time, b must eventually follow*.

### **Refined Natural Language Translation:**
*"At every point in time, if **a** holds, then **b** must eventually hold in the future."*

#### **When is this formula satisfied?**
- The system satisfies **G(a → Fb)** if, in every possible execution trace:
  - Whenever *a* is true at any moment, there is a later moment where *b* becomes true.
  - If *a* never occurs, the formula is trivially satisfied.

#### **When does it impose constraints?**
- The formula enforces that *b* must eventually happen after every occurrence of *a*.
- It does **not** require *b* to happen if *a* never happens.
- It does **not** require *b* to happen immediately after *a*—only that it must happen at some future point.

#### **Example Interpretation:**
- If *a* represents *"a request is made"* and *b* represents *"the request is fulfilled,"*
  then **G(a → Fb)** means:
  *"Every request must eventually be fulfilled."*

### **Final Answer:**
The formula **G(a → Fb)** means:
*"Globally, whenever **a** holds, **b** must eventually hold in the future."*
Or, equivalently:
*"At all times, if **a** is true, then **b** must eventually become true."*
