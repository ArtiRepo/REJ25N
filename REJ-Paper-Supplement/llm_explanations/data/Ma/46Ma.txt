Here’s the structured translation of the LTL formula **`F d | G !n`** into natural language:

---

### **1. Original LTL Formula**
`F d | G !n`
*(Read as: "F d or G not n")*

---

### **2. Parsing Tree Breakdown**
The formula is a **disjunction (OR)** of two subformulas:
1. **Left subformula**: `F d`
   - `F` = "Eventually" (temporal operator)
   - `d` = atomic proposition (e.g., "door is open")
2. **Right subformula**: `G !n`
   - `G` = "Globally" (temporal operator, meaning "always in the future")
   - `!n` = negation of atomic proposition `n` (e.g., "button is **not** pressed")

```
        OR (|)
       /    \
     F d    G !n
```

### **3. Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up**
#### **Left Subformula: `F d`**
- **Meaning**: *"Eventually, `d` becomes true at some future point."*
  - **Satisfied when**: There exists at least one future state where `d` holds.
  - **Constraints**:
    - The system **must** reach a state where `d` is true (but not necessarily immediately).
    - If `d` never becomes true, the formula is violated.

#### **Right Subformula: `G !n`**
- **Meaning**: *"`n` is **never** true in any future state (i.e., `!n` holds globally)."*
  - **Satisfied when**: `n` is false in **every** state from the current moment onward.
  - **Constraints**:
    - The system **must** ensure `n` never occurs (e.g., a safety property like "the button is never pressed").

#### **Combining with OR (`|`)**
- **Meaning**: *"Either `d` eventually happens, **or** `n` never happens (or both)."*
  - **Satisfied when**:
    - **Case 1**: `d` becomes true at some point (regardless of `n`).
    - **Case 2**: `n` never becomes true (regardless of `d`).
    - **Case 3**: Both conditions hold (e.g., `d` eventually occurs, and `n` never does).
  - **Violated only when**:
    - `d` **never** occurs **and** `n` **does** occur at some point.

---
### **4. Refined Natural Language Phrasing**
**Formal Translation**:
*"The system must guarantee that either:
1. The property `d` eventually holds (at some future time), **or**
2. The property `n` never holds (from now onward)."*

**Example Interpretation** (with concrete propositions):
- Let `d` = "the door unlocks" and `n` = "the alarm is triggered."
  *"Either the door will eventually unlock, or the alarm will never be triggered (or both)."*

**Key Nuances**:
- The formula is **non-strict**: It allows both `d` and `!n` to hold simultaneously.
- It is **not** requiring `d` to happen *if* `n` happens (that would be an implication, `G (n → F d)`).
- The disjunction makes it a **"weak" requirement**: The system has flexibility to satisfy either condition.

---
### **5. When Is This Useful?**
This pattern often appears in:
- **Fallback systems**: "Either achieve goal `d`, or avoid failure condition `n`."
- **Liveness-safety tradeoffs**: "Eventually do `d`, unless `n` is a risk (in which case never allow `n`)."*
- **Monitoring**: "Alert only if neither `d` happens nor `n` is avoided."

\* *Note: The formula doesn’t explicitly link `d` and `n`; they’re independent unless the system’s logic connects them.*
