Here’s the structured translation of the LTL formula **`!G c`**:

---

### **1. Original LTL Formula**
```
!G c
```

---

### **2. Parsing Tree Breakdown**
The formula can be broken down as follows:
```
      !
     /
    G
   /
  c
```
- **`c`**: A proposition (atomic statement) that is either true or false at any given time step.
- **`G c`**: The *globally* operator applied to `c`, meaning "`c` holds **at all future time points** (including the present)."
- **`!G c`**: The negation of `G c`, meaning "It is **not the case** that `c` holds at all future time points."

---

### **3. Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up**
1. **Base case (`c`)**:
   - At any moment in time, `c` is either true or false (e.g., "the system is in state `c`").

2. **`G c` (Globally `c`)**:
   - This means "`c` is **always true** from now onward, forever."
   - **Satisfaction**: The system must never leave `c` at any future point.
   - **Violation**: If `c` becomes false even once in the future, `G c` is violated.

3. **`!G c` (Negation of `G c`)**:
   - This means "`c` is **not always true** in the future."
   - **Satisfaction**: There exists **at least one future moment** where `c` is false.
     - This could happen immediately (now) or later.
   - **Violation**: If `c` remains true forever (i.e., `G c` holds), then `!G c` is violated.

---
### **4. Refined Natural Language Phrasing**
**Formal Translation**:
*"It is not the case that `c` holds globally in the future."*
or equivalently:
*"`c` does not hold at every future time point (i.e., `c` will eventually fail)."*

**Intuitive Explanation**:
- The formula **`!G c`** requires that the system **must not stay in `c` forever**.
- It guarantees that at some point (now or later), `c` will become false.
- **Key constraint**: The system is **forbidden from being "stuck" in `c` indefinitely**.

**Examples**:
1. If `c` = "the door is locked":
   - `!G c` means *"The door will not remain locked forever"* (it must unlock at some point).
2. If `c` = "the system is in safe mode":
   - `!G c` means *"The system will eventually exit safe mode."*

**Contrast with Similar Formulas**:
- `F !c` (*"Eventually, `c` will be false"*):
  - Stronger than `!G c` because it explicitly demands that `!c` occurs *at some future point*.
  - `!G c` is satisfied even if `c` is false *now* (no future requirement), whereas `F !c` requires `!c` to happen *later*.
- `!c` (*"`c` is currently false"*):
  - Only concerns the present moment, while `!G c` concerns the entire future.

### **5. When Is the Formula Satisfied/Violated?**
| Scenario                          | `!G c` Satisfied? | Explanation                                  |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `c` is false now.                 | ✅ Yes             | `G c` fails immediately (since `c` is false now). |
| `c` is true now but becomes false later. | ✅ Yes       | `G c` fails at the later point.              |
| `c` remains true forever.         | ❌ No              | `G c` holds, so `!G c` is violated.           |

---
### **6. Summary**
**`!G c`** means:
*"The system is not permanently in state `c`; `c` will fail at some point (now or in the future)."*
This is a **liveness-like property** (something must eventually happen: the end of `c`).
