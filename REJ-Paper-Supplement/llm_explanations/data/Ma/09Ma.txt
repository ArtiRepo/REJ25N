Here’s the structured breakdown and translation of the LTL formula **(c & b) U a**:

---

### **1. Original LTL Formula**
**(c & b) U a**

---

### **2. Parsing Tree Breakdown**
The formula is a **binary operator** with two subformulas:
- **Left operand**: `(c & b)` (conjunction of atomic propositions `c` and `b`).
- **Operator**: `U` ("**until**"), a temporal operator that relates the left and right operands over time.
- **Right operand**: `a` (atomic proposition).

```
        U
      /   \
  (&)      a
   /  \
  c    b
```

### **3. Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up**

#### **Step 1: Conjunction `(c & b)`**
- **Meaning**: "Both `c` **and** `b` hold **simultaneously** in the current state."
- **When satisfied**: At any time point where *both* `c` and `b` are true.
- **Constraints**: The system must ensure `c` and `b` are true together whenever this subformula is evaluated.

#### **Step 2: Until Operator `(...) U a`**
The `U` operator combines the left (`(c & b)`) and right (`a`) operands with the following semantics:
- **"(c & b) holds *until* a becomes true."**
  - **Formal definition**: There exists *some future state* where `a` becomes true, **and** in *all states* from now until that future state, `(c & b)` holds continuously.
  - **Key implications**:
    1. **Termination**: `a` *must* eventually become true (the "until" condition is not vacuous).
    2. **Persistence**: Until `a` occurs, `(c & b)` must remain true *without interruption*.

#### **Step 3: Combining the Parts**
- The formula asserts:
  > *"From the current state onward, `c` and `b` must both hold continuously **until** a state where `a` becomes true (which must happen eventually)."*

### **4. Refined Natural Language Phrasing**
To maximize clarity, we can phrase it as:

> **"The system must maintain both `c` and `b` as true simultaneously at every step, *until* the condition `a` is eventually satisfied. The occurrence of `a` is guaranteed to happen in the future."**

#### **Additional Clarifications**:
- **When satisfied**:
  - If `a` is true *immediately* in the current state, the formula is trivially satisfied (since the "until" interval has zero length).
  - If `a` is false now, then `(c & b)` must hold now *and* in all future states until `a` becomes true.
- **When violated**:
  - If `(c & b)` fails *before* `a` occurs (e.g., `c` or `b` becomes false).
  - If `a` *never* occurs (the "until" condition is never met).

#### **Example Scenario**:
- Imagine a traffic light system where:
  - `c`: "Crosswalk button is pressed."
  - `b`: "Pedestrian is waiting."
  - `a`: "Light turns green for pedestrians."
- The formula **(c & b) U a** means:
  > *"While the button is pressed **and** a pedestrian is waiting, the light must not change to green for cars (i.e., the system must keep `c` and `b` true) until the light eventually turns green for pedestrians (`a`)."*

---
### **Key Takeaways**
- The `U` operator enforces **two constraints**:
  1. **Persistence** of `(c & b)` until `a`.
  2. **Eventuality** of `a`.
- The formula is **not satisfied** if `a` never occurs or if `(c & b)` fails before `a`.
