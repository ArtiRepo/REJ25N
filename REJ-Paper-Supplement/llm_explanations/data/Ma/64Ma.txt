### **Original LTL Formula:**
**G(a → XXXa)**

---

### **Parsing Tree Breakdown:**
The formula can be decomposed as follows:

1. **G (Globally)**
   - Temporal operator: "For all future time points..."
   - Scope: The entire formula inside **G** must hold at every state in the trace.

2. **→ (Implication: a → XXXa)**
   - Logical operator: "If *a* holds now, then *XXXa* must hold."
   - Left operand: **a** (atomic proposition, holds at the current state).
   - Right operand: **XXXa** (temporal operator applied to *a*).

3. **XXX (Next-Next-Next)**
   - Three nested **X** (neXt) operators:
     - **Xa**: *a* holds in the **next** state.
     - **XXa**: *a* holds in the **state after the next** (i.e., two steps ahead).
     - **XXXa**: *a* holds **three steps ahead** of the current state.

---
### **Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up:**

1. **XXXa**:
   - "*a* holds **three time units in the future** from the current state."
   - Example: If the current time is *t*, then *XXXa* is true at *t* iff *a* is true at *t+3*.

2. **a → XXXa**:
   - "If *a* is true **now**, then *a* must also be true **three steps later**."
   - This is a **local constraint**: It only applies at states where *a* holds.

3. **G(a → XXXa)**:
   - "For **all time points** in the trace, the implication *a → XXXa* must hold."
   - In other words:
     - Whenever *a* occurs at any point, it must recur exactly three steps later.
     - If *a* never occurs, the formula is trivially satisfied (vacuously true).

---
### **Refined Natural Language Translation:**
**"At every moment in time, if the property *a* holds, then it must hold again exactly three time units later."**

---
### **When Is the Formula Satisfied?**
The formula imposes the following constraints on the system's behavior over time:

1. **Satisfied if:**
   - Every occurrence of *a* is followed by another occurrence of *a* **precisely three steps later**.
   - Example trace (where *a* is true at positions 0, 3, 5, 8, ...):
     ```
     Time: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ...
     a:    T F F T F T F F T ...  (Satisfies G(a → XXXa))
     ```
     - At *t=0*: *a* is true → *a* must be true at *t=3* (which it is).
     - At *t=3*: *a* is true → *a* must be true at *t=6* (but it’s false; **this trace actually violates the formula**).
     - *Corrected example* (fully satisfying):
       ```
       Time: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ...
       a:    T F F T F F F F T ...  (a at 0 → a at 3; no other a’s to check)
       ```

2. **Violated if:**
   - There exists at least one state where *a* is true, but *a* is **not** true three steps later.
   - Example:
     ```
     Time: 0 1 2 3 4 5 ...
     a:    T F F F F F ...  (a at 0, but not at 3 → violation)
     ```

3. **Trivially satisfied if:**
   - *a* **never** holds in the trace (the implication’s premise is always false).

---
### **Key Observations:**
- The formula does **not** require *a* to hold at any specific time; it only enforces a **conditional recurrence** when *a* does hold.
- It is **not** a liveness property (it doesn’t guarantee *a* will eventually hold), but a **safety property** (it restricts how *a* can occur).
- The "three-step" delay is strict; *a* cannot recur earlier or later than exactly three steps after its occurrence.
