Here’s the structured breakdown and translation of the LTL formula **FGa**:

---

### **1. Original LTL Formula**
**FGa**
*(where **a** is an atomic proposition, e.g., "the system is in state *a*")*

---

### **2. Parsing Tree Breakdown**
The formula is composed of two temporal operators applied sequentially:
```
      F
       \
        Ga
```
- **Innermost subformula**: `a` (atomic proposition).
- **First operator applied**: `G` (Globally/Always).
  - `Ga` means "*a holds in all present and future states*" (i.e., "always *a*").
- **Outer operator**: `F` (Finally/Eventually).
  - `F(Ga)` means "*there exists some future point after which `Ga` holds forever*."

---

### **3. Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up**
1. **Atomic proposition `a`**:
   - A basic statement about the system (e.g., "the door is locked," "the temperature is > 100°C").

2. **`Ga` (Globally `a`)**:
   - "*From the current moment onward, `a` is always true.*"
   - **Satisfaction**: `a` must hold in every state of every possible future path starting now.
   - **Constraint**: The system must never violate `a` after this point.

3. **`F(Ga)` (Finally `Ga`)**:
   - "*There exists some future moment after which `Ga` becomes permanently true.*"
   - **Satisfaction**:
     - The system may temporarily *not* satisfy `a` (or `Ga`) initially.
     - At some later point, `a` must start holding **forever** (i.e., `Ga` becomes true and stays true).
   - **Constraint**:
     - The system is *not* required to satisfy `a` immediately or always.
     - It must eventually reach a "stable" state where `a` becomes invariant.

---
### **4. Refined Natural Language Phrasing**
**Formal Translation**:
*"Eventually, the system will reach a state after which `a` holds permanently (i.e., `a` becomes always true from that point onward)."*

**Examples with Context**:
1. **Robotics**:
   *"The robot will eventually enter a mode where its battery is always charging (and never discharges again)."*
   - Initially, the battery might drain, but at some point, it starts charging continuously.

2. **Network Protocols**:
   *"The connection will eventually stabilize in a state where the latency is always below 50ms."*
   - Early in the connection, latency might spike, but later it permanently drops below the threshold.

3. **Everyday Scenario**:
   *"You will eventually adopt a habit where you always floss after brushing your teeth."*
   - You might skip flossing at first, but from some day onward, you never skip it again.

---
### **Key Nuances**
- **Not "always eventually"**: `FGa` is *not* the same as `GFa` (which means "`a` holds infinitely often"). Here, `a` must hold *continuously* after some point.
- **Weak vs. Strong Fairness**:
  - `FGa` is a *weak fairness* condition: it guarantees `a` will *eventually* become permanent, but doesn’t specify how soon.
  - Contrast with `FG(a ∧ b)`, which might require multiple properties to stabilize together.
- **Violation**: The formula is violated if `a` is *never* permanently true (e.g., `a` flickers on/off infinitely).

---
### **When Is This Useful?**
- **Liveness Properties**: Ensuring the system reaches a "good" stable state (e.g., deadlock freedom, termination).
- **Safety + Liveness**: Combining with other operators (e.g., `FGa ∧ (¬a U b)`) to describe phased behavior.
