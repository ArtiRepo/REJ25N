**Original LTL formula:**  
F ¬b  

**Step-by-Step Meaning Construction:**  
1. **¬b (inner formula):**  
   "b is false in a specific state."  
   - *Constraints:* Only applies to one state (b must be false there).  
   - *No constraint elsewhere:* b can be true or false in all other states.  

2. **F(¬b) (outer formula):**  
   "There exists at least one state (now or in the future) where ¬b holds (i.e., b is false)."  
   - *Constraint activation:* Requires b to be false at some state along the path.  
   - *Termination of constraint:* The formula is satisfied immediately when b becomes false at any state. After satisfaction, no further constraints apply (b can be true or false arbitrarily afterward).  

**Refined Natural Language Translation:**  
"*Eventually, b must be false at least once (which could be now or at any future state).*"  

**Key Clarifications:**  
- **Satisfaction condition:** The formula holds if b is false in the current state or becomes false in any future state. Once satisfied (at the first occurrence where b is false), the constraint ends.  
- **Violation condition:** The formula is violated *only* if b is true in **every state** (current and all future states).  
- **Temporal scope:**  
  - No ongoing constraints before satisfaction: b can be true or false arbitrarily until the state where b becomes false.  
  - No constraints after satisfaction: Once b is false at any state, the formula imposes no further restrictions (b can change arbitrarily).  
- **Common misunderstanding:** This does not require b to be false infinitely often (only once); it does not mandate when b becomes false beyond "eventually."  

**Example:**  
- *Satisfying path:* b=true, b=true, **b=false**, b=true, ... → Formula holds at **b=false**.  
- *Violating path:* b=true, b=true, b=true, ... (always true) → Formula falsified.
