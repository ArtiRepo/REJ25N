**Original LTL Formula:**  
`F (f => j)`

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**  
1. **Innermost Expression (`f => j`):**  
   - Implication `f => j` (equivalent to `¬f ∨ j`).  
   - **Meaning:** At any given state, if `f` is true, then `j` must be true *in that same state*. If `f` is false, `j` can be true or false (no constraint on `j`).  
   - **Constraint applies only when evaluated**; it does not constrain other states.  

2. **Apply `F` (Eventually):**  
   - `F (f => j)` requires that **at least one state** in the future (including the current state) satisfies `(f => j)`.  
   - **Key behavior:** The entire formula is permanently satisfied as soon as a state with `(f => j)` is encountered. Future states are unconstrained afterward.  

**Refined Natural Language Translation:**  
> "**Eventually, there is a state where if f is true, then j is also true in that same state (and if f is false at that state, j can be either true or false).**"  

**Additional Clarifications (as per guidelines):**  
- **When constraints apply:**  
  - The system is constrained only until a state satisfying `(f => j)` occurs.  
  - In that critical state:  
    - If `f` is true, `j` **must** be true (hard constraint).  
    - If `f` is false, `j` is unconstrained.  
  - After satisfying the condition, **no further constraints** are imposed (e.g., subsequent `f`/`j` can behave freely).  

- **Satisfying traces (examples):**  
  - A state where `f` is false (even if `j` is false).  
  - A state where `f` and `j` are both true.  
  - If `f` never holds, the formula holds vacuously (e.g., `f` false forever).  

- **Violating traces:**  
  - **Only if** in **every state**, `f` is true and `j` is false.  

- **Crucial nuance:**  
  - The formula **does not require** `f` to become true; it holds if `f` remains false forever.  
  - If `f` is sometimes true, **at least one** such `f`-true state must have `j` true (but not necessarily all).  
  - Once satisfied, later violations (e.g., `f` true and `j` false) are irrelevant.  

**Final Translation:**  
> "Eventually, there is a state where if f is true, then j is also true."
