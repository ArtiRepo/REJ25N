**Original LTL Formula:**  
\( t \Rightarrow (x \land y) \)

**Rebuilding the Formula from the Bottom Up:**  
1. **Atomic propositions \(x\) and \(y\)**:  
   Each must hold in the current state where they are evaluated but imposes no constraints on other states.  

2. **Conjunction \(x \land y\)**:  
   Requires both \(x\) and \(y\) to hold **simultaneously in the current state**.  

3. **Implication \( t \Rightarrow (x \land y) \)**:  
   If \(t\) is true in the current state, then \(x \land y\) must also hold.  
   If \(t\) is false, the implication is satisfied **regardless of \(x\) or \(y\)**.  

**Natural Language Translation:**  
"In the current state:  
- If \(t\) is true, both \(x\) and \(y\) must be true.  
- If \(t\) is false, no constraints apply to \(x\) or \(y\).  
This requirement applies **only to the current state** and imposes no restrictions on future states."

### Key Clarifications:  
- **Satisfaction at the current state**:  
  The formula is evaluated and must hold **only at the state where it is checked** (e.g., the initial state of the trace).  
  - **Satisfied if**:  
    - \(t\) is false (no matter \(x\) or \(y\)), *or*  
    - \(t\) is true and both \(x\) and \(y\) are true.  
  - **Violated if**:  
    - \(t\) is true, but \(x\) or \(y\) (or both) are false.  

- **Temporal constraints**:  
  The formula **does not constrain future states**. For example:  
  - If \(t\) is true and \(x \land y\) holds now, any future values of \(t\), \(x\), or \(y\) are irrelevant.  
  - If \(t\) is false now, \(x\) and \(y\) can hold or not in any future state.  

- **Misconception prevention**:  
  This is **not a global constraint**. The obligation ends immediately after the current state.
