**Original LTL formula:**  
XXFXa  

**Translation process:**  
1. **Innermost subformula `Xa`**:  
   "At a reference state, the next immediate state must satisfy `a`."  

2. **Apply `F` to `Xa`**:  
   `F(Xa)` → "From a reference state, there must exist a future state (including itself) such that at that state, the next immediate state satisfies `a`."  
   → *Refined*: "`a` must hold at a state that is exactly one step after some future state of the reference."  
   → *Implication*: `a` holds at a state at least one step after the reference (minimal offset: state 1 after the reference).  

3. **Apply outer `X` to `F(Xa)`**:  
   `X(F(Xa))` → "At the next state from a reference, `F(Xa)` must hold."  
   → *Effect*: Shifts the reference state forward by one. `F(Xa)` now evaluates from the new reference.  
   → *Requirement*: `a` must hold at a state at least one step after the new reference (minimal offset: state 2 from the original reference).  

4. **Apply outermost `X` to `X(F(Xa))`**:  
   `XX(F(Xa))` → "At the next state from the current state, `X(F(Xa))` must hold."  
   → *Effect*: Shifts the reference state forward by another step. `X(F(Xa))` now evaluates from this second state.  
   → *Requirement*: `a` must hold at a state at least one step after this second state (minimal offset: state 3 from the current state).  

**Final refined translation**:  
"`a` must be true at some state that is **at least three states in the future** (i.e., in the third state or beyond, counting the current state as state 0)."  

**Key clarifications**:  
- **Constraints**:  
  - `a` must hold **at least once** at some state ≥3 (e.g., state 3, 4, ...).  
  - No constraints on `a` at states 0, 1, or 2: `a` can be true or false in these states without affecting satisfaction.  
- **Violation**:  
  - If `a` is **never** true at state 3 or beyond, the formula is violated.  
  - Example violation path: `a` false for all states ≥3 (even if true at states 0–2).  
- **Satisfaction**:  
  - `a` true at **any state ≥3** suffices (e.g., true only at state 3, or at state 5, etc.).  
  - Example satisfaction path: `a` false at states 0–2, true at state 3.  
- **Evolution**:  
  - Evaluated at the current state (state 0). If satisfied, constraints cease once `a` holds at a future state ≥3.  
  - If `a` holds early (e.g., state 4) but a suffix later violates `a` beyond state 4, the formula may still hold if the *first* satisfaction occurs at state 4.  

**Avoid misinterpretations**:  
- Not "`a` holds at the *third state specifically*" — it can hold later.  
- Not "`a` must hold repeatedly" — a single occurrence at ≥ state 3 suffices.
