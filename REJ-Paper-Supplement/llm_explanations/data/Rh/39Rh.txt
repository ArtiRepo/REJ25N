**Original LTL Formula:**  
`b U (d & a)`

**Rebuilding Meaning:**  
1. **Innermost subformula: `d & a`**  
   - Requires both `d` and `a` to be true simultaneously in a single state.  
   - Constraints apply only at that specific state; no further timeline requirements.

2. **Until operator (`U`) with `b` and `(d & a)`:**  
   - `b U (d & a)` requires:  
     - **Existence**: There must be a state (starting now or in the future) where `d & a` holds.  
     - **Persistence**: Until the very moment that `d & a` holds, `b` must be true in every preceding state.  
   - Once a state satisfies `d & a`, the constraint on `b` ceases for all subsequent states (including that state).  

**Natural Language Translation:**  
*Eventually, both `d` and `a` must be true simultaneously. Until that happens (if it does not occur immediately), `b` must be true in every state. At the state where `d` and `a` both become true, `b` may be either true or false.*  

### Key Clarifications:  
- **Satisfaction**:  
  - **If `d & a` holds now**: The formula is immediately satisfied (no constraints on `b` at this state).  
  - **If `d & a` holds later (at state `k`)**:
    - `b` must be true in every state *between now and `k−1`*.  
    - `b` is unconstrained at state `k` (and beyond).  
- **Violation**:  
  - Fails if `d & a` never holds.  
  - Fails if `d & a` holds at state `k` but there is any state `i < k` where `b` is false.  
- **Constraints over time**:  
  - The requirement for `b` applies only *until the state before* `d & a` holds.  
  - Once `d & a` holds (at any point), the formula imposes no further constraints.  

**Example Sequence:**  
Consider a trace: `b=true, d=false, a=false` → `b=true, d=true, a=false` → `b=false, d=true, a=true`.  
- **Outcome**: Satisfied (at the last state, `d & a` holds, and `b` was true in all prior states).  
- **Note**: `b` is false at the state where `d & a` holds, which is allowed.  

This phrasing avoids ambiguities in temporal constraints, explicitly distinguishing immediate and deferred satisfaction.
