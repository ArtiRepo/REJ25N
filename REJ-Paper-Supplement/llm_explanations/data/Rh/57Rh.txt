**Original LTL Formula:**  
Fa ∧ G(a → XG¬a)  

**Rebuilt from Bottom Up:**  
1. **XG¬a:** "From the state immediately *after* the current state, ¬a holds *forever*."  
   *(Constraint: Requires ¬a in all future states starting from the next state.)*  
2. **a → XG¬a:** "If a is true *in the current state*, then ¬a *must hold forever starting from the very next state*."  
   *(Constraint: Applies only when a is true in the current state. When false, no constraint is imposed.)*  
3. **G(a → XG¬a):** "In *every state* of the execution, if a is true, then ¬a *must hold forever after the next state*."  
   *(Constraint: Enforces that any occurrence of a forces ¬a forever starting at the next state. If a is never true, this holds vacuously.)*  
4. **Fa:** "a *must eventually be true* in at least one future (or current) state."  
   *(Constraint: Guarantees at least one state where a is true. Before this, a may be true or false without constraint.)*  
5. **Fa ∧ G(a → XG¬a):** Combines (3) and (4).  

**Refined Natural Language Phrasing:**  
> "a must become true **exactly once** in the entire execution. Furthermore, **immediately after** that single occurrence of a, ¬a must hold **forever** in all subsequent states."  

**Key Insights:**  
- **Behavior:**  
  - Before a becomes true: a may be true *or* false (no constraints, but if a appears early, it triggers the "forever ¬a" rule immediately).  
  - At the **exact state** where a is true: It activates G(a → XG¬a), forcing ¬a *in every state afterward*.  
  - After a is true: ¬a *must hold indefinitely*, and a **cannot reappear** (any later a would violate the "forever ¬a" constraint from the first occurrence).  
- **Violation Conditions:**  
  - If a *never* occurs: Fa fails.  
  - If a occurs *more than once*: The second occurrence breaks "¬a forever" enforced by the first.  
  - If ¬a fails *in any state after a becomes true*: Violates XG¬a.  
- **Constraints Evolve Over Time:**  
  - Initially, until a is true, only Fa applies (requiring a future occurrence).  
  - Once a occurs: The constraint shifts to "¬a forever," and Fa is permanently satisfied.  
- **Misunderstanding Alert:**  
  - Despite G(a → XG¬a), a *is not forbidden* in the first state—it may hold initially (triggering immediate forever ¬a).  
  - The formula does **not** constrain events *before* the first a (a may briefly hold or not), but it *forbids a after its first occurrence*.
