**Original LTL Formula:**  
`a U (c & d)`  

**Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up:**  
1. **`c & d`**: "Both `c` and `d` must be true *simultaneously in the same state*."  
2. **`a U (c & d)`**:  
   - **Requirement 1**: "Eventually, a state must occur where `c & d` holds."  
   - **Requirement 2**: "From the current state until the exact moment `c & d` holds (inclusive), `a` must be true in *every intermediate state*."  
   - **Constraint Timeline**:  
     - `a` is required in all states *until and including* the first state where `c & d` becomes true.  
     - After `c & d` holds, `a` is no longer constrained (may become true or false).  

**Refined Natural Language Phrasing:**  
> "`a` must hold continuously until a state is reached where both `c` and `d` are true simultaneously. Such a state where `c` and `d` are both true must eventually occur."

### Key Clarifications:  
- **Constraints on variables**:  
  - `a` must be true in **every state** from the current state up to (and including) the state where `c & d` becomes true.  
  - `c` and `d` only constrain **one specific future state** (where both hold together).  
  - Before `c & d` holds, `a` cannot become false (not even once).  
- **When constraints cease**:  
  - The obligation for `a` ends **immediately after** `c & d` holds.  
  - `c & d` must hold **exactly once** (at the first occurrence where both are true).  
- **Violation Scenarios**:  
  - If `a` is false in any state *before* `c & d` holds → formula false.  
  - If `c & d` never holds → formula false (even if `a` holds forever).  
- **Satisfaction Edge Case**:  
  - If `c & d` holds *now*, `a` is only required in the current state → formula true instantly.
