**Original LTL formula:**  
(d | !b) U !a  

**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**  
1. **Base propositions:**  
   - `d`: "d is true in the current state."  
   - `b`: "b is true in the current state."  
   - `!a`: "a is false in the current state."  
   - `!b`: "b is false in the current state."  

2. **Disjunction (|):**  
   - `(d | !b)`:  
     - "**d is true or b is false** in the current state."  
     - Equivalently: "**If b is true, then d must be true** (since if b is true, d must hold to satisfy the disjunction). If b is false, the formula is satisfied regardless of d."  

3. **Until (U):**  
   - `(d | !b) U !a`:  
     - "**Eventually, a must become false** (∃ a future state where `!a` holds)."  
     - "**Until the state where a first becomes false**, the condition `(d | !b)` must hold in **every preceding state**."  
     - **Key implications**:  
       - If `!a` is true **now**, the formula is **immediately satisfied** (no constraints on `b`/`d` in this state).  
       - If `!a` is false (i.e., `a` is true now), `(d | !b)` **must hold now and in every future state** until `a` becomes false for the first time.  
       - Once `a` becomes false, **all constraints cease** (in that state and beyond, `d` and `b` are unconstrained).  
     - **Violation occurs** if:  
       - `a` **never** becomes false, OR  
       - Before the first `!a`, there is a state where `b` is true and `d` is false (i.e., `(d | !b)` fails).  

**Refined Natural Language Phrasing:**  
> "Eventually, **a must become false**. Until that moment, whenever **b is true, d must also be true**."  

### Key Clarifications:  
- **Constraints apply** only **strictly before** the first occurrence of `!a`:  
  - If `a` is true *now*, then `(b → d)` must hold *now* and in *all states* until (but excluding) the state where `a` becomes false.  
- **No constraints on or after `!a`**:  
  - In the state where `a` becomes false, `b`/`d` can be arbitrary.  
  - All states *after* the first `!a` are unconstrained.  
- **Immediate satisfaction**: If `a` is false in the current state, the formula holds unconditionally (no need to check `d`/`b`).  
- **Liveness requirement**: `!a` **must eventually occur**; the formula fails if `a` remains true forever.
