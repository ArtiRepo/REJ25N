**Original Formula:**  
F a ∧ F b  

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**  
1. **F a**: This means "eventually a" – there must exist at least one future state where `a` is true.  
   *   Constraint: `a` must be true in some state.  
   *   Until `a` happens, the requirement remains active. Once `a` occurs, this part is satisfied permanently.  

2. **F b**: This means "eventually b" – there must exist at least one future state where `b` is true.  
   *   Constraint: `b` must be true in some state.  
   *   Until `b` happens, the requirement remains active. Once `b` occurs, this part is satisfied permanently.  

3. **Conjunction (F a ∧ F b)**: Both `F a` and `F b` must hold.  
   *   Constraints persist until **both** `a` and `b` have occurred at least once.  
   *   The timing of `a` and `b` is independent: they may occur in any order (e.g., `a` first then `b`, `b` first then `a`, or simultaneously).  

**Translated Natural Language:**  
> "Eventually, `a` must become true, and eventually, `b` must become true, each at least once during the execution. The constraints for `a` and `b` remain active until both events occur. After both have happened, no further constraints from this formula apply, and the formula remains satisfied."  

**Key Clarifications:**  
- **Unsatisfied until completion**: The formula is violated if **either** `a` or `b` never occurs.  
- **Satisfaction trigger**: The formula becomes permanently true as soon as **both** `a` and `b` have each occurred (e.g., after the second of the two events).  
- **No constraints after fulfillment**: Once both `a` and `b` have happened, the formula imposes no future requirements (e.g., `a` and `b` may be false afterward).  
- **No order dependency**: `a` and `b` are not required to occur simultaneously or in a specific sequence.  

**Example:**  
- *Satisfying path*: `a` occurs at step 1, `b` occurs at step 3 → Formula is true from step 3 onward.  
- *Violating path*: `a` occurs infinitely often, but `b` never occurs → Formula is false forever.
