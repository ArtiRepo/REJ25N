**Original LTL Formula:**  
`G(XXa => !a)`

**Rebuilding the Meaning:**  
1. **`XXa`**: "a is true two states after the current state."  
2. **`!a`**: "a is false in the current state."  
3. **`XXa => !a`**: "If a is true two states later, then a must be false now."  
4. **`G(...)`**: "The entire execution must satisfy `XXa => !a` at **every** state."  

**Refined Translation:**  
"Globally, if a is true two states after any state, then a must be false in that state. Equivalently: Whenever a is true at any state, it must be false two states later."

**Detailed Explanation:**  
- **Constraints imposed:**  
  - If at state `i`, `a` is true, then **`a` must be false at state `i+2`**.  
  - If `a` is false at state `i`, **no immediate constraint** is imposed on `a` at `i` or `i+2` (the formula holds regardless of future values).  
- **When constraints apply and cease:**  
  - The constraint triggered by `a` being true at state `i` **only applies to the state 2 steps later** (`i+2`).  
  - Once `a` is false at `i+2`, the obligation from state `i` is satisfied.  
- **Evaluation at each state:**  
  - At state `i`, check: If `a` will be true at `i+2`, then `a` must be false at `i`.  
  - The formula holds at `i` if either:  
    (a) `a` is false at `i` (no matter what happens at `i+2`), or  
    (b) `a` is true at `i` **and** `a` is false at `i+2`.  
- **Satisfying vs. Violating Sequences:**  
  - **Satisfies**: Any trace where no `true` for `a` is followed by `true` at `i+2`, e.g.:  
    - `a = [F, F, F, ...]` (always false).  
    - `a = [T, T, F, F, T, F, ...]` (true at `i` forces false at `i+2`).  
  - **Violates**: Any trace with a state `i` where `a = T` at `i` **and** `a = T` at `i+2`, e.g.:  
    - `a = [T, ..., T]` at states `i=0` and `i=2` (violation at `i=0`).  

**Key Clarifications:**  
- The constraint is **local and forward-looking**: Each state `i` checks if `a` is true at `i+2`, but **does not constrain states beyond** `i+2`.  
- If `a` is never true, the formula holds trivially (all implications evaluate as true).  
- **Misconception**: The formula does not require `a` to eventually become true or false; it only forbids pairs of `a=true` exactly 2 steps apart.  

**Final Natural Language Phrasing:**  
"Globally, whenever a becomes true at a state, a must be false two states later."
