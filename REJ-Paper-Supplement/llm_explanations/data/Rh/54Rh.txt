**Original LTL formula**:  
(a U b) and G(a)  

**Translation with Bottom-Up Reasoning**:  
1. `a U b`:  
   - Requires that **b eventually becomes true**, and **a is true in every state** until that moment.  
   - Constraints relax after `b` becomes true: `a` must hold *only* until `b` becomes true (and may become false afterward).  

2. `G(a)`:  
   - Requires that **a is true in every state of the execution**, forever.  

3. `(a U b) and G(a)`:  
   - The `until` (`a U b`) demands that `b` eventually holds, with `a` holding until then.  
   - `G(a)` **strengthens** the constraint on `a`: It forces `a` to hold *even after* `b` becomes true, overriding the relaxation allowed by `a U b`.  
   - Thus, `a` must now hold **eternally** (from `G(a)`), and `b` must still **eventually hold** (from `a U b`).  

**Final Natural Language Phrasing**:  
"**a must be true in every state, and b must eventually become true in some state.**"  

**Key Constraints Explained**:  
- **After the formula is checked**:  
  - `a` must be **immediately true** (required by both `G(a)` and the initial constraint of `a U b`).  
  - If `b` is true *now*, the "until" is immediately satisfied, but `a` must persist forever.  
  If `b` is false *now*, `a` must hold continuously **until** `b` becomes true.  
- **Over time**:  
  - `a` **cannot be false in any state** (violates `G(a)`).  
  - `b` **must be true at least once** (otherwise `a U b` fails).  
  - Once `b` becomes true, it does not need to hold again, but `a` must **never** become false.  

**Violations**:  
- `b` remains false forever → `a U b` fails.  
- `a` is false at any point (now or in the future) → `G(a)` fails.  
- `a` is false *before* the first occurrence of `b` → `a U b` fails (even if `b` eventually holds).  

**Satisfaction**:  
- All states have `a = true`, and at least one state has `b = true` (e.g., `(a,¬b) → (a,b) → (a,¬b) → ...`).
