**Original LTL formula:**  
a U !a  

**Translation:**  
"The formula requires that *a* becomes false at some state (including the present), and in every state from the current state until (but not including) the state where *a* becomes false, *a* must be true."  

**Explanation of constraints:**  
1. **Immediate and future constraints:**  
   - If *a* is false in the **current state**, the formula is immediately satisfied (no further constraints are imposed).  
   - If *a* is true in the current state, the formula requires:  
     - *a* remains true in **every subsequent state** until a future state where *a* turns false.  
     - *a* **must eventually turn false** (cannot remain true indefinitely).  

2. **Scope of constraints:**  
   - The requirement for *a* to be true **applies only from the current state** until the state immediately before *a* becomes false.  
   - Once *a* becomes false for the **first time**, the formula is satisfied, and **no future constraints** are imposed (even if *a* later becomes true again).  

3. **Violations:**  
   - **Violation occurs** if *a* is initially true and remains true **forever** (since *a* never becomes false).  
   - **Violation does not occur** if *a* becomes false at any point, including immediately.  

**Key clarifications:**  
- "Until" requires *a* to hold **only up to (not including)** the state where *!a* becomes true.  
- After *a* becomes false, **no constraints** are enforced by this formula.  
- The formula **does not guarantee** *a* will become true again after turning false; it only constrains behavior *until the first* occurrence of *!a*.
