**Original LTL formula**:  
G a  

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom up**:  
1. **Atomic proposition `a`**:  
   - "`a` must be true in the *current state*."  
   - Constraints on other states: None.  

2. **Apply `G` (globally) operator**:  
   - The `G` operator extends the requirement of `a` to **all states**:  
     - "`a` must be true in the current state **and** in *every future state* of the execution."  

**Refined natural language phrasing**:  
- **"`a` must be true in every state of the execution, from now onward."**  

### Key Clarifications:  
- **Constraints over time**:  
  - **Applies immediately**: `a` must hold **now** (in the current state).  
  - **Ongoing constraints**: `a` must **hold forever** in all future states.  
  - **Constraint ceases**: **Never**. The requirement persists indefinitely.  

- **Satisfaction vs. Violation**:  
  - **Satisfied only if**: `a` is true in **all states** (e.g., `a, a, a, a, ...`).  
  - **Violated if**: `a` is false in **any state** (e.g., `a, a, false, ...`).  
    - The formula is violated **immediately** when a state violates `a`, and remains violated thereafter.  

- **Common misunderstanding**:  
  - The constraint **never expires** or weakens over time. A single failure violates the entire specification.
