### Translation of LTL Formula: \(X(!g \lor !j)\)

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**  
1. **Innermost expressions**:  
   - \(!g\): "\(g\) is false" at a specific state.  
   - \(!j\): "\(j\) is false" at a specific state.  

2. **Disjunction (\(!g \lor !j\))**:  
   - "At least one of \(g\) or \(j\) must be false in a given state."  
   - *Equivalent to*: "\(g\) and \(j\) cannot both be true simultaneously in that state."  

3. **Next-state operator (\(X\))**:  
   - \(X(!g \lor !j)\) applies the disjunction **exclusively to the immediate next state** after the current evaluation point.  

**Refined Natural Language Translation:**  
"**In the very next state, \(g\) and \(j\) cannot both be true.**"  

### Key Clarifications:  
- **Constraints on the current state**:  
  None. The formula imposes **no requirements** on \(g\) or \(j\) in the current state (they can be true, false, or both true).  
- **Constraints on the next state**:  
  \(g\) and \(j\) **must not both be true** in the immediate next state.  
- **Beyond the next state**:  
  No constraints apply. The formula **does not restrict** any states beyond the immediate next one.  
- **Violation condition**:  
  The formula is violated **only if** the next state has both \(g\) and \(j\) true.  
- **Satisfaction timeline**:  
  The formula is evaluated at time \(t\). It is satisfied **if and only if** at time \(t+1\), at least one of \(g\) or \(j\) is false.

**Note**: This formula expresses a **single-step constraint** concerning mutual exclusion in the next immediate state.
