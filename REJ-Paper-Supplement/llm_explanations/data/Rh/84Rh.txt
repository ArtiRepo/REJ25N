### Translation of LTL Formula: \( G (a \land X b) \)

#### Step-by-Step Rebuilding:
1. **Innermost components**  
   - **\( a \)**: "a must be true in the current state (no constraints on future/past states).  
   - **\( X b \)**: "b must be true in the very next state."  

2. **Conjunction (\( a \land X b \))**  
   - "a must be true in the current state, **and** b must be true in the immediate next state."  
   - *Constraints*: Applies **only to the current state**. Violation occurs if either:  
     - a is false now, or  
     - b is false at the next state.  
   - Truth value is determined using the current state (for a) and the next state (for b). Does not constrain earlier states.  

3. **Global Operator (\( G(\dots) \))**  
   - Applies \( (a \land X b) \) **at every state** in the execution.  
   - "In every state, a must be true now and b must be true in the next state."  

#### Refined Natural Language Translation:  
> "a must be true at every step, and b must be true at every step starting from the immediate next state."

#### Key Constraints:
- **On a**: True for **all states** (without exception).  
- **On b**:  
  - **Excludes the initial state**: b may be true/false at time \( t=0 \) → no constraint on the initial b.  
  - **All states after \( t=0 \)**: b must be true (starting at \( t=1, t=2, \dots \)).  
  - *Why?* The requirement \( X b \) in each state forces b to hold in the subsequent state.  

#### Behavior Over Time:
- **At the start (\( t=0 \))**:  
  - a must be true; b must be true at \( t=1 \).  
- **At any state \( t=k \) (\( k \ge 0 \))**:  
  - a must be true; b must be true at \( t=k+1 \).  
- **Termination**: Not applicable (infinite traces assumed).  

#### Satisfying vs. Violating Examples:
| Time | State Sequence | Satisfied? | Explanation |
|------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| ✅   | `a,b` → `a,b` → `a,b` → ... | Yes | a always true; b always true after \( t=0 \). |
| ✅   | `a` (b false) → `a,b` → `a,b` → ... | Yes | b false at \( t=0 \) allowed; b true from \( t=1 \) onward. |
| ❌   | `a` → `a,b` → `¬a,b` → ... | No | `¬a` violates \( a \) at \( t=2 \). |
| ❌   | `a` → `¬b,a` → ... | No | `¬b` at \( t=1 \) violates \( X b \) requirement from \( t=0 \). |
| ❌   | `a` → `a,b` → `a,¬b` → ... | No | `¬b` at \( t=2 \) violates \( X b \) requirement from \( t=1 \).  

#### Critical Notes:
- **Recursive Constraint**: Each state imposes a requirement on b in the next state (chain reaction).  
- **Initial State Exception**: b may be arbitrary at \( t=0 \).  
- **All-States Coverage**: a is constrained everywhere; b is constrained from \( t=1 \) until forever.  
- **Misinterpretation Warning**: The formula **does not require b at \( t=0 \)**.
