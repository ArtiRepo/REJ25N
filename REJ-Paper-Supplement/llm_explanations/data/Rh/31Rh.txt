**Original LTL formula:**  
d & X (c U a)  

**Translation and Explanation:**  
1. **"d must be true in the current state."**  
   - Constraint: `d` is required at the current state (state 0).  
   - Unconstrained: States before or after state 0.  
   - Evaluation: Fails if `d` is false at state 0. Otherwise, the first part is satisfied.  

2. **"a must eventually be true starting from the next state."**  
   - Constraint: There exists a state at index *k ≥ 1* where `a` is true.  
   - Obligation: `a` must become true at least once at state 1 or later. Violated if `a` never becomes true after state 0.  

3. **"c must be true in every state from the next state until (but not including) the state where a becomes true."**  
   - Constraint: For all states from state 1 through state *k−1* (where *k* is the first state where `a` is true), `c` must hold.  
   - Release: When `a` becomes true at state *k*, `c` is no longer required (even if `c` is false at *k*).  
   - Edge case: If `a` is true at state 1, the constraint on `c` for states 1 to *k−1* vacuously holds (no states to check).  

**Complete Natural Language Phrasing:**  
"**d is true in the current state. Starting from the next state, c must hold continuously until—but not including—the state where a becomes true, and a must eventually become true (at or after the next state).**"  

**Satisfying Examples:**  
- State 0: `d=true`; State 1: `a=true` *(c unconstrained at state 1)*.  
- State 0: `d=true`; State 1: `c=true`, `a=false`; State 2: `a=true` *(c not required at state 2)*.  

**Violating Examples:**  
- `d=false` at state 0 *(fails immediately)*.  
- `d=true` at state 0, but `a` never true after state 0 *(violates eventual requirement)*.  
- `d=true` at state 0; State 1: `c=false`, `a=false` *(fails c requirement at state 1)*.  
- `d=true` at state 0; State 1: `c=true`, `a=false`; State 2: `c=false`, `a=false` *(fails c requirement before a occurs)*.  

**Key Notes:**  
- Constraints on `c` apply **only** between state 1 and the state before `a` first becomes true.  
- Constraint on `a` requires its **first occurrence** after state 0; additional/prior occurrences are irrelevant.  
- Once `a` holds (anytime after state 0), `c` is **never required again** by this formula.
