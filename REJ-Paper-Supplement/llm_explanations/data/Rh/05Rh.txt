**Original LTL formula:**  
X a & b  

**Step-by-step reasoning and translation:**  
1. **Atomic propositions:**  
   - `b`: Must be true **in the current state** and is unconstrained elsewhere.  
   - `a`: Appears in `X(a)`, requiring specific behavior at the next state.  

2. **Temporal operator "X" (next):**  
   - `X a`: Must be true **exclusively if `a` holds in the immediate next state**.  

3. **Conjunction "&" (AND):**  
   - Combines `X a` and `b`: Requires **both** components to hold:  
     - `b` must be true **now** (current state).  
     - `a` must be true **in the next state**.  

**Natural Language Translation:**  
"b must be true in the **current state**, and a must be true **in the next state**."  

**Key Constraints and Timing:**  
- **Current state (t=0):**  
  - `b` must be true.  
  - `a` can be true or false (no constraint).  
- **Next state (t=1):**  
  - `a` must be true.  
  - `b` can be true or false (no constraint after t=0).  
- **All other states (t≥2):**  
  - No constraints on `a` or `b` (values are unconstrained).  

**Satisfaction vs. Violation:**  
- **Holds if:** At time t=0, `b` is true, and at t=1, `a` is true.  
  *Example sequence: [b=true, a=true, ...] (arbitrary beyond t=1).*  
- **Fails if:**  
  - `b` is false at t=0, or  
  - `a` is false at t=1.  
  *Counterexample: `b` false now, OR `a` false next (even if `b` is true now).*  

**Clarifications:**  
- The formula **only binds `b` at t=0 and `a` at t=1**; no future obligations exist beyond t=1.  
- Violation is determined **immediately** if `b` is false at t=0; if `b` holds, failure occurs at t=1 if `a` is false.
