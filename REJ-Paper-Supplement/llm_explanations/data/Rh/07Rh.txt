**Original LTL Formula:**  
a U c  

**Translation and Explanation:**  
The formula **a U c** translates to:  
*"c must eventually become true, and until that specific moment, a must remain true in every state. Once c becomes true, a is no longer required to hold."*  

### Key Constraints:  
1. **c must eventually hold** at some state (which could be the current state or any future state).  
2. **a must hold continuously** from the **current state** up to (but *not* including) the state where c first becomes true.  
3. If c is already true in the current state, there are **no constraints** on a (past or present).  
4. After c becomes true, there are **no future constraints** on a or c.  

### Evaluation Over Time:  
- **At the current state:**  
  - If **c is true now**, the formula is **immediately satisfied** with no constraints on a.  
  - If **c is false now**, **a must be true now**, and c must eventually become true while a holds continuously until then.  
- **In subsequent states:**  
  - If c has not yet occurred, **a must hold** in each state.  
  - The formula is **permanently satisfied** once c becomes true.  

### Violation Conditions:  
- **c never becomes true**, regardless of a.  
- **a becomes false before c occurs**, even if c later becomes true.  

### Misconception Clarification:  
- The formula **does not require a to hold at the exact state where c becomes true**.  
- After c holds, **both a and c are unconstrained** for all future states.  

**Example Traces:**  
- `[a, a, c, ...]` → **Satisfied** at state 0. (a holds until c at state 2).  
- `[c, ...]` → **Satisfied** at state 0. (c holds immediately).  
- `[a, ¬a, c, ...]` → **Violated** at state 1 (a fails before c).  
- `[a, a, a, ...]` → **Violated** (c never occurs).
