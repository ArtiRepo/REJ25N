**Original LTL Formula:**  
`G(a -> XXXa)`  

**Step-by-Step Translation:**  
1. **Innermost operator `Xa`:**  
   "`Xa` requires `a` to be true one state after the current state."  

2. **`XXa` (equivalent to `X(Xa)`):**  
   "`XXa` requires `a` to be true two states after the current state."  

3. **`XXXa` (equivalent to `X(XXa)`):**  
   "`XXXa` requires `a` to be true three states after the current state."  

4. **Implication `a -> XXXa`:**  
   "If `a` is true in the *current* state, then `a` must be true three states later. If `a` is false now, no constraint is imposed."  

5. **Globally `G(...)`:**  
   "In **every state** of the execution, if `a` is true at that state, `a` must be true **exactly three states later**. This constraint applies repeatedly at every step."  

**Final Natural Language Translation:**  
> "Globally, whenever `a` is true at some state, `a` must be true exactly three states later."  

**Key Explanations:**  
- **Satisfaction/violation:**  
  - **Holds** if:  
    - `a` is never true (no constraints triggered), or  
    - Every occurrence of `a` at state *i* has a corresponding `a` true at state *i+3*.  
  - **Violated** if:  
    - There exists any state *i* where `a` is true, but `a` is false at state *i+3*.  
  - Example violation: A sequence where `a` holds at state 0, but fails at state 3.  

- **Constraints over time:**  
  - **Triggered** immediately when `a` is true at any state *i*, mandating `a` at *i+3*.  
  - **Ceases** for state *i* once *i+3* is reached (if `a` holds there).  
  - If `a` is true at multiple states (e.g., *i*, *i+1*), *each* triggers its own constraint for *i+3*, *i+4*, etc.  

- **Critical clarifications:**  
  - Does **not require** `a` to be true initially, in between states (e.g., *i+1*, *i+2*), or periodically forever.  
  - Constraints are **state-specific and finite**: Once `a` is satisfied at *i+3*, the obligation for state *i* ends.  
  - If `a` holds at *i+3*, this triggers a **new** constraint for *i+6* (via the global operator), and so on.  

**Semantic Summary:**  
This formula enforces a *causal chain*: Any truth of `a` propagates an obligation exactly 3 steps forward. The system is unconstrained where `a` is false, but any isolated `a` must be followed by another `a` 3 states later to satisfy the formula.
