**Original LTL formula**:  
`F (d => !h)`  

**Natural Language Translation**:  
"**At some point (current or future), there must be a state where if `d` is true, then `h` is false.**"  

### Detailed Breakdown:  
1. **Inner formula (`d => !h`)**  
   - Meaning: "In a specific state, if `d` is true, then `h` must **not** be true."  
   - Equivalently: "`d` and `h` cannot **both be true** in the same state."  
   - This is a state-based constraint with **no temporal requirements**; it only applies to the properties of a single state.  

2. **Outer operator (`F`)**  
   - Meaning: "There must exist **at least one state** (immediately or later) where the inner formula (`d => !h`) holds."  
   - This requires that **eventually**, in any state, the condition "if `d` then not `h`" is satisfied.  

### Key Constraints:  
- **Satisfaction condition**: The formula is satisfied if **any single state** in the execution (current or future) meets either:  
  - `d` is **false** (regardless of `h`),  
  - `h` is **false** (regardless of `d`),  
  - Or **both are false**.  
- **Violation condition**: The formula is **only violated** if `d` and `h` are **always both true in every state** of the execution. If this occurs, `d => !h` never holds.  
- **Immediate vs. ongoing constraints**:  
  - If satisfied **immediately** (current state meets `d => !h`), the formula imposes **no future constraints**.  
  - If **not immediately satisfied**, the system must **eventually** reach a state where `d` and `h` are not both true.  
- **Scope of obligations**:  
  - **Before** the satisfying state: Both `d` and `h` may be true arbitrarily often.  
  - **After** the satisfying state: `d` and `h` are **unconstrained** (they can be both true, both false, or mixed arbitrarily).  

### Example Scenarios:  
- ✅ **Satisfied**: A state where `d` is true and `h` is false (at any point).  
- ✅ **Satisfied**: A state where `d` is false (even if `h` is true).  
- ❌ **Violated**: All states have `d` true **and** `h` true.  

**Clarification**: The formula **does not require** `d` or `h` to hold persistently. It only demands **one state** where they are not both true.
