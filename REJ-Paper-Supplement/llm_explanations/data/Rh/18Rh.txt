**Original LTL Formula:**  
`!F (a & b)`  

**Step-by-Step Translation:**  
1. **Innermost Expression (`a & b`):**  
   "Both `a` and `b` are true in the **same state**."  

2. **Temporal Operator `F` (`F (a & b)`):**  
   "There exists at least one future state where `a` and `b` are **simultaneously true**."  

3. **Negation `!` (`!F (a & b)`):**  
   "It is **never true** (in any state of the execution) that `a` and `b` are both true simultaneously."  

**Final Natural Language Translation:**  
"`a` and `b` are **never simultaneously true** in the entire execution."  

**Key Constraints and Satisfaction Conditions:**  
- **Constraint:** At **every state** of the execution, `a` and `b` must **not both hold** (they are mutually exclusive).  
- **Satisfied if:** For **all states**, at least one of `a` or `b` is false.  
- **Violated if:** **Any single state** exists where both `a` and `b` are true.  
- **Temporal Scope:** The constraint applies **immediately** from the first state and **persists indefinitely** (no point after which it no longer applies).  

**Examples:**  
- **Satisfying trace:** `a=false, b=false` → `a=true, b=false` → `a=false, b=true` → ...  
  *(Explanation: `a` and `b` never true together in any state.)*  
- **Violating trace:** ... → `a=true, b=false` → `a=true, b=true` → ...  
  *(Explanation: Violated as soon as both `a` and `b` are true in one state.)*  

**Clarifications:**  
- **No restrictions** on the occurrence of `a` or `b` individually (either or both may be true at different times).  
- **Misinterpretation Warning:** `!F (a & b)` is **not** equivalent to `G(!a) ∨ G(!b)` (which requires one to be always false). It only forbids simultaneous truth.
