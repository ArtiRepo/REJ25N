### Original LTL Formula:  
**X (f & i)**  

### Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up:  
1. **Innermost subformula**: `f & i`  
   - **Meaning**: Both propositions `f` AND `i` must be true in the **same state**.  
   - **Constraint**: Applies *only* to the state where this conjunction is evaluated.  

2. **Apply X operator**: `X (f & i)`  
   - **Meaning**: The requirement `(f & i)` must hold in the **immediate next state** (one step after the current state).  
   - **Constraint**: Applies *exclusively* to the next state.  

### Natural Language Translation:  
**"In the very next state, both f and i must be true."**  

### Key Explanations:  
- **Satisfaction condition**:  
  - The formula is satisfied if, **at the current state**, the system transitions to a state where **both `f` and `i` are true**.  
  - **Example**: If the next state has `f = true` and `i = true`, the formula holds.  

- **Violation condition**:  
  - The formula is violated if, in the **next state**, either `f` is false, `i` is false, or both are false.  
  - **Example**: If the next state has `f = false` (even if `i = true`), the formula fails.  

- **Temporal scope**:  
  - **Constraints apply only to the next state**. Before or after this state, `f` and `i` are unconstrained.  
  - **At the current state**, `f` and `i` can be true/false—no impact.  
  - **Beyond the next state**, `f` and `i` can be true/false—no impact.  

- **Misunderstanding prevention**:  
  - The constraint is **not ongoing**. It imposes a one-time requirement strictly on the **immediately succeeding state**.
