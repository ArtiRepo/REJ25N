### LTL Formula: **(c & b) U a**

#### Rebuilding Meaning from Bottom Up:
1. **Atomic Propositions**:  
   - `c` must be true in a given state.  
   - `b` must be true in a given state.  
   - `a` must be true in a given state.  
   `c & b` requires **both `c` and `b` to be true simultaneously** in a single state.

2. **Until Operator (`U`)**:  
   The formula `(c & b) U a` is structured as:  
   > "`c & b` must hold continuously **until** `a` becomes true, at which point `a` **must** hold."

   Key constraints:  
   - **`a` must eventually become true** at some future state (including the current state).  
   - **Until `a` becomes true**, `c & b` must hold **in every state** (including the current state if `a` is false now).  
   - **After `a` holds**, `c & b` is **no longer required** (in the state where `a` holds or any future state).

#### Natural Language Translation:  
**"Eventually `a` must occur. Until then, both `c` and `b` must hold continuously."**

#### Key Clarifications:
- **Immediate Satisfaction**:  
  - If `a` is true **now**, the formula is **instantly satisfied** (no requirement for `c` or `b` in the current state).  
  - Example: `a=true` at the start satisfies the formula, regardless of `c` and `b`.

- **Delayed Satisfaction**:  
  - If `a` is false now, **both `c` and `b` must be true now** and in **every subsequent state** until (and excluding) the state where `a` first becomes true.  
  - Example:  
    `c=true, b=true` for states t₀→t₂, then `a=true` at t₃ (no constraints on `c`/`b` at t₃ onwards).

- **Constraints Lifted When `a` Holds**:  
  - At the **exact state where `a` becomes true**, `c` and `b` can be **true or false**.  
  - **After `a` holds**, `c` and `b` are **unconstrained** for all future states.

- **Violations**:  
  - `a` **never occurs**: Formula fails (even if `c` and `b` always hold).  
  - `c` or `b` **false before `a`**: Fails if either is false in any state from now until just before `a` occurs.  
    Example: `a=false`, `c=true`, `b=false` at t₀ → immediate violation.

#### Summary Timeline:
| Time          | Requirement                          | Constraints Cease When...         |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Now** (t₀)  | `a` true? → no `c`/`b` needed.       | If `a` true now.                  |
|               | `a` false? → `c` and `b` both true.  |                                   |
| **t₀ → t₋₁**  | `c` and `b` must **both hold**.      | At first `a` occurrence (tᵢ).     |
| **State tᵢ**  | `a` **true** (first occurrence).     | `c`/`b` can be true/false at tᵢ. |
| **After tᵢ**  | **No constraints** on `a`, `c`, or `b`. | — |

This formula prioritizes **eventual occurrence of `a`** and imposes **strict coexistence of `c` and `b` only until `a` arrives**.
