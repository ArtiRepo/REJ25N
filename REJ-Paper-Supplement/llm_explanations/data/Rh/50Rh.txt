**Original LTL formula**:  
F (o U u)  

**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up**:  
1. **Inner formula (o U u)**:  
   *"u must eventually hold at some future state; until the moment when u holds, o must hold continuously in every state. At the very state where u holds, o is unconstrained."*  

2. **Outer operator F**:  
   *"There must exist a future state (call it **j**) such that at **j**, the inner formula (o U u) holds. However, the choice of **j** is flexible: **j** can be any state where u holds."*  

   - At the chosen future state **j**:  
     - If **u holds immediately at j**, the inner formula (o U u) is instantly satisfied (since there are no states between j and itself to require o).  
     - If **u does not hold at j**, then o must hold continuously from j until u later becomes true at some state **k > j**.  
   - Crucially, **any future state where u holds** ensures the inner formula (o U u) holds at **j = k**. Thus, the only requirement is that **u eventually holds at least once**.  

**Refined natural language phrasing**:  
*"u must become true at least once at some future state."*  

### Key implications:  
- **Constraint on u**: u must be true in **at least one state** in the future.  
  - *Satisfied if*: A state exists where u is true (e.g., trace: `u=false, u=false, u=true`).  
  - *Violated if*: u is **never** true (e.g., infinite trace: `u=false, u=false, ...`).  
- **Constraint on o**: **None**.  
  - The formula imposes **no requirements** on o—o can be true or false in **any state (past, present, or future)** without affecting satisfaction.  
- **Evolution of truth**:  
  - The formula is **satisfied at the initial state** if u **ever** holds later.  
  - Constraints on u persist **until u occurs**. Once u holds (at **any** future state), the formula is permanently satisfied. No further constraints apply afterward.  

### Pitfalls avoided:  
- **Misunderstanding**: The inner (o U u) **appears** to require o until u, but the outer **F** allows using the very state **where u becomes true** as the starting point. At that state, no prior or o-states are required, making the condition **equivalent to F(u)**.  
- **Conciseness**: The core constraint is solely about **the eventuality of u**.
