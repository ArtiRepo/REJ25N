### Original LTL Formula  
**b U (a | d)**  

### Natural Language Translation  
"There must be a state (possibly the current state) where either **a** or **d** (or both) is true.  
Until that state (exclusively), **b** must hold continuously in every state from the present onward.  
If the current state already satisfies **a** or **d**, no constraint is imposed on **b**."

### Reasoning: Rebuilding Meaning Step-by-Step (Bottom-Up Approach)  

#### Step 1: Break down the disjunction `a | d`  
- **Meaning**: At any given state, `a | d` is true if **a or d (or both)** holds.  
- When does it constrain variables?  
  - It constrains **a** and **d** *only* at **the state where it is evaluated**.  
  - **False only when both a and d are false** at that state.  

#### Step 2: Apply the `U` (Until) operator to `b U (a | d)`  
- **Until semantics**:  
  1. **Right operand** (`a | d`) must eventually become true in some state (the "target" state).  
  2. **Left operand** (`b`) must hold in every state from the **current state** until **immediately before the target state**.  
- Constraints:  
  - **b** must be true in all states **preceding** the target (even at the current state if it’s not the target).  
  - The target state **satisfies `a | d`** but **no constraint** on `b` at that state.  
- Special case: If the **current state** satisfies `a | d`, **the formula is immediately true** (b is unconstrained everywhere).  

#### Step 3: Refine Phrasing for Clarity  
- **Where constraints apply**:  
  - `b` must hold **only in states before the target state**. If `a | d` holds at the current state, **no b is required** at any time.  
  - `a | d` constraints apply **only at the target state**.  
- **Violation conditions**:  
  - `a | d` **never occurs** → formula false.  
  - `b` **fails in any state** before the first `a | d` → formula false.  
- **Temporal evolution**:  
  - When checked at a state where `a | d` is false, `b` must hold **immediately** and persist until `a | d` triggers.  
  - Once `a | d` holds, the formula is **satisfied forever** (no future constraints).

### Final Translation (Structured for Conciseness)  
**b U (a | d)** constrains the system as follows:  
1. **Trigger**: A state must occur where **a or d is true** (this may be immediately).  
2. **Constraint Phase**:  
   - If the trigger is **not immediate**, **b must be true** consistently from the current state until **the state before the trigger**.  
3. **After Trigger**: **b is unconstrained** (may become false).  
4. **Unsatisfied Conditions**:  
   - **a** and **d** remain **permanently false**, or  
   - **b fails** before the first **a | d** becomes true.
