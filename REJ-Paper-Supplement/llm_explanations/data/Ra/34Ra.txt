### Translation of LTL Formula: `G (!f | !i)`

#### Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
- **Formula**: `G (!f | !i)`

#### Step 2: Break down the formula into a parsing tree
The parsing tree is constructed from atomic propositions upward:
```
      G         (Globally)
       |
       |          (OR / Disjunction)
      ( | )
      /   \
     !     !     (NOT operators)
     |     |
     f     i     (Atomic propositions)
```

- **Atomic propositions**: `f` and `i` (e.g., "feature is active" or "interrupt is asserted").
- **Negations (`!`)**: 
  - `!f`: "`f` is false".
  - `!i`: "`i` is false".
- **Disjunction (`|`)**: `!f | !i` means "either `f` is false **or** `i` is false (or both)".
- **Global operator (`G`)**: `G (...)` means "**always**, in every future state".

#### Step 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom up
1. **Base components**:
   - `f`: Represents a system state (e.g., "Engine is on").
   - `i`: Another system state (e.g., "Maintenance mode is active").

2. **Apply negations**:
   - `!f`: "Engine is **not** on".
   - `!i`: "Maintenance mode is **not** active".

3. **Apply disjunction (`|`)**:
   - `!f | !i`:  
     "Either the engine is **off**, OR maintenance mode is **inactive**, OR **both**."  
     **Logical implication**: If `f` were true, then `!i` must be true (i.e., if the engine is on, maintenance must *not* be active). If `i` were true, then `!f` must be true (i.e., if maintenance is active, the engine *cannot* be on).  
     **Violation**: Only if **both `f` and `i` are true** simultaneously (e.g., "Engine on **while** in maintenance mode").

4. **Apply global operator (`G`)**:
   - `G (!f | !i)`:  
     "For **all states now and in the future**, either `f` is false, or `i` is false (or both)"  
     → This means: **`f` and `i` can *never* be true at the same time**.

#### Step 4: Refine natural language phrasing for clarity
- **Key insight**: The formula forces `f` and `i` to be **mutually exclusive globally**.  
- **Possible translations**:
  1. > "At all times, `f` and `i` cannot both be true."  
  2. > "The system must **always** ensure that `f` and `i` never happen simultaneously."  
  3. > "Globally: Either `f` is disabled, or `i` is disabled, or both."

**Final Refined Translation**:  
> **"`f` and `i` are mutually exclusive at every moment: It is never allowed for both to be true simultaneously, now or in the future."**

##### Examples:
- **Satisfied**:  
  - If `f` is true, `i` must be false.  
  - If `i` is true, `f` must be false.  
  - Both `f` and `i` are always false.  
- **Violated**:  
  - Any timeline where `f = true` and `i = true` **at the same time** (e.g., at time `t=3`).  

This constraint ensures safety (e.g., no engine activation during maintenance) or logical consistency across all system states.
