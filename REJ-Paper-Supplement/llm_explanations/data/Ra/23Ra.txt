### Translation of LTL Formula: `t => w`

#### Step 1: Original LTL Formula  
`t => w`  

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
- **Implication (`=>`)**  
  - **Left child: Atomic proposition `t`**  
    Represents a condition that can be true/false at a specific time.  
  - **Right child: Atomic proposition `w`**  
    Represents another condition at the same instant.  

Tree structure:  
```
   =>  
  / \  
 t   w  
```

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning Step-by-Step  
1. **Atomic propositions (`t` and `w`):**  
   - `t` holds at a moment if the system satisfies property `t` (e.g., "a timer expires").  
   - `w` holds at a moment if property `w` is true (e.g., "a warning is issued").  

2. **Implication (`t => w`):**  
   - Semantics: `t IMPLIES w` ≡ `¬t ∨ w`.  
   - At any state:  
     - If `t` is true, `w` **must also be true** (enforcement).  
     - If `t` is false, `w` can be true or false (no constraint).  

3. **Temporal Scope:**  
   - Since no temporal operators (e.g., `G`, `F`) are used, the formula applies **at every individual state** independently.  

#### Step 4: Natural Language Translation  
- **Clear phrasing:**  
  > **"At any moment when `t` holds, `w` must also hold at that same moment."**  

- **Refinements for clarity:**  
  - **Scope:** Only constrains states where `t` is true; says nothing if `t` is false.  
  - **Violation:** The formula fails at any state where `t` is true but `w` is false.  
  - **Example:**  
    - Rule: `"When the temperature exceeds 100°C (t), an alarm sounds (w)."`  
    - Violation: Temperature is 105°C, but no alarm sounds.  

#### Final Explanation  
- **Satisfaction:** The formula is satisfied if, throughout the system's execution, `w` is true whenever `t` is true at the exact same moment.  
- **Constraint:** It forbids scenarios where `t` is true but `w` is false at any point.  
- **Illustrative Counterexample:** A trace `... {t=true, w=false} ...` falsifies `t => w` at the state with `(t=true, w=false)`.  

**Key Insight:** This is a **state-local constraint**—it relates conditions at the same instant without involving future/past states.
