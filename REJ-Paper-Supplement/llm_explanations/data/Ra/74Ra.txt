### Translation of the LTL Formula: `G(a or b)`  
**Original Formula:**  
`G(a ∨ b)`

### Step 1: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
- **Root operator:** `G` (Globally)  
  - **Argument:** `a ∨ b` (disjunction)  
    - **Left child:** Atomic proposition `a`  
    - **Right child:** Atomic proposition `b`  

**Tree Structure:**  
```
     G  
      |  
    (a ∨ b)  
    /     \  
   a       b  
```

---

### Step 2: Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up  
1. **Atomic propositions (`a` and `b`):**  
   - `a` and `b` represent basic state conditions (e.g., "the light is on," "the door is locked").  
   - **Meaning:** These are true or false at individual points in time.  

2. **Disjunction (`a ∨ b`):**  
   - True if **at least one** of `a` or `b` holds in the **current state**.  
   - **Meaning:** "`a` is true or `b` is true (or both) at this moment."  

3. **Globally operator (`G`):**  
   - Applies to `a ∨ b`, requiring it to hold **for all states** in the future.  
   - **Meaning:** "In every state from now on, `a ∨ b` must be true."  

---

### Step 3: Natural Language Translation  
Combining the steps:  
- **Core meaning:** "At every point in time, either `a` is true or `b` is true (or both)."  

**Refined phrasing:**  
> "**Always, at least one of `a` or `b` is true.**"

### Key Implications for System Behavior  
- **Satisfaction condition:** Every state in the system’s timeline must satisfy `a ∨ b`.  
  - Example: If `a = "system_active"` and `b = "backup_engaged"`, the system must **never** enter a state where both are false.  
- **Constraint:** Violation occurs if there is **any future state** where *both* `a` and `b` are false.  
  - Example violation: A timeline `[a=true, b=true, a=false **and** b=false, ...]`.  
- **Practical guarantee:** Ensures no "gaps" in system behavior (e.g., always operational or safeguarded).

### Example Contexts  
1. **Safety-critical system:**  
   - `a = "airbag_activated"`, `b = "seatbelt_locked"`  
   - Translation: *"The airbag must always be active or the seatbelt locked (or both)."*  
   Ensures continuous safety coverage.  

2. **Resource management:**  
   - `a = "battery_charged"`, `b = "generator_running"`  
   - Translation: *"At all times, the battery must be charged or the generator running (or both)."*  
   Prevents total power loss.  

--- 
**Final Translation:**  
**"The system must ensure that, at every point in time, either proposition `a` holds or proposition `b` holds (or both)."**
