### Translation of LTL Formula: (c U a) & (b U a)

#### Step 1: Original LTL Formula
```
(c U a) & (b U a)
```

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown
- **Conjunction** (`&`) at the root, with two branches:
  - **Left branch**: Until operator (`c U a`)
    - Left child: Atomic proposition `c`
    - Right child: Atomic proposition `a`
  - **Right branch**: Until operator (`b U a`)
    - Left child: Atomic proposition `b`
    - Right child: Atomic proposition `a`

```
      &
     / \
    U   U
   / \ / \
  c  a b  a
```

#### Step 3: Rebuild Meaning from the Bottom Up
1. **Atomic propositions** (`a`, `b`, `c`):
   - `a`, `b`, `c` represent system states (e.g., "event `a` occurs", "property `b` is true").

2. **Until subformulas** (`c U a` and `b U a`):
   - `c U a`: Requires that `c` holds continuously **until** `a` becomes true. Specifically:
     - There exists a future time `k` where `a` holds.
     - For all times from **now** to `k-1`, `c` must hold.
     - If `a` holds now (`k=0`), the formula is satisfied immediately (no `c` required).
   - `b U a`: Analogously, `b` must hold continuously until `a` becomes true.

3. **Conjunction (`&`)**:
   - Both `(c U a)` and `(b U a)` must hold simultaneously.
   - **Key insight**: The two `U` operators constrain behavior until **the same occurrence** of `a` (specifically, the *earliest* `a`). For both conditions to be satisfied:
     - `a` must occur at some time `j` (if not already true now).
     - For all times from **now** to `j-1`:
       - `(c U a)` requires `c` to hold.
       - `(b U a)` requires `b` to hold.
     - Thus, **`b` and `c` must both hold** at every step until `a` occurs.

#### Step 4: Equivalent Simpler Formula
The original formula is equivalent to:  
**(b ∧ c) U a**  
This means:  
- `a` must hold eventually (at time `j`).  
- Until `j` (i.e., at all times from **now** to `j-1`), **both `b` and `c`** hold continuously.  
If `a` holds now, no constraints are imposed on `b`/`c` for past/future steps (as the `U` condition is immediately satisfied).

#### Step 5: Natural Language Translation
**Refined phrasing for clarity:**  
> "`a` must eventually occur, and until `a` occurs, both `b` and `c` must hold continuously at every step."

**Explanation of system behavior:**  
- **When satisfied**:  
  - `a` becomes true at some point.  
  - If `a` is not yet true, `b` and `c` both hold in every state leading up to the first occurrence of `a`.  
- **When violated**:  
  - `a` never occurs, OR  
  - `a` occurs, but at some point before its first occurrence:  
    - `b` is false, OR  
    - `c` is false.  

##### Key Scenarios
- **`a` holds now**: Formula is satisfied instantly (no constraints on `b`/`c` now or in the future).  
- **`a` holds at future time `j`**: At all times between now and `j-1`, `b` and `c` must both be true.  
- **`a` never holds**: Formula fails indefinitely.  
- **Before `a`, `b`/`c` fail**: Formula fails at the first violation of `b` or `c`.  

This constraint ensures `a` eventually becomes true, and until then, the system maintains `b` and `c` simultaneously.
