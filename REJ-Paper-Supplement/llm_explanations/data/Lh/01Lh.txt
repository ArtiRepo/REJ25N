## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: X a => X c

## 2: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
To understand this formula, let's break it down:
- X a means "a must be true in the very next state."
- X c means "c must be true in the very next state."
- The implication => means that if the antecedent (X a) is true, then the consequent (X c) must also be true.

## 3: Analyze the implication X a => X c
The formula X a => X c can be read as: "If a is true in the next state, then c must also be true in the next state."

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
A concise and clear natural language translation is: "In the next state, if a is true, then c must be true."

## 5: Explain satisfaction and constraints
- The formula is satisfied if either a is false in the next state (since false implies anything is true) or if both a and c are true in the next state.
- It imposes a constraint that if a becomes true in the next state, c must also be true in the next state.
- The constraint only applies to the next state and does not affect the current state or any states beyond the next one.

## 6: Describe evaluation and evolution of truth value
- At the moment of checking, the formula's truth value depends on the next state's values of a and c.
- If a is false in the next state, the formula is immediately satisfied regardless of c's value.
- If a is true in the next state, c must also be true for the formula to be satisfied.

The final answer is: $\boxed{X a => X c}$
