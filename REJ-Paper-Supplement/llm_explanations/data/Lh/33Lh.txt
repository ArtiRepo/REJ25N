## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: `(b U c) & (d U !b)`.

## 2: Break down the formula into its components
We have two main components:
1. `b U c`
2. `d U !b`

## 3: Interpret the first component, `b U c`
`b U c` means: "c must eventually become true, and until that specific moment, b must remain true in every state."

## 4: Interpret the second component, `d U !b`
`d U !b` means: "!b must eventually become true (meaning b must eventually become false), and until that specific moment, d must remain true in every state."

## 5: Combine the interpretations under the conjunction (&)
The entire formula `(b U c) & (d U !b)` requires that both conditions be met simultaneously. This means:
- "c must eventually become true, and until c becomes true, b must be true."
- "b must eventually become false, and until b becomes false, d must be true."

## 6: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula implies that:
- Initially, both b and d must be true.
- b must remain true until c becomes true.
- d must remain true until b becomes false.
- The condition that b becomes false and c becomes true can happen in any order, but both must happen.

## 7: Specify when the formula imposes constraints and when it does not
The formula imposes constraints from the start:
- b and d must be true initially.
- It imposes ongoing constraints:
  - b must stay true until c is true.
  - d must stay true until b is false.
- Once b becomes false and c becomes true, no further constraints are imposed by this formula.

## 8: Describe satisfaction and violation conditions
The formula is satisfied if:
- There exists a point where c is true and b was true until then.
- There exists a point where b is false and d was true until then.

It is violated if:
- c never becomes true while b is true.
- b never becomes false while d is true.

## 9: Final natural language translation
The system must initially have b and d true. From then on, b must stay true until c becomes true, and d must stay true until b becomes false. After b becomes false and c becomes true, the system is unconstrained by this formula.

The final answer is: 
`(b U c) & (d U !b)` translates to: "The system starts with b and d true. b must stay true until c is true, and d must stay true until b is false. After b becomes false and c becomes true, there are no further constraints."
