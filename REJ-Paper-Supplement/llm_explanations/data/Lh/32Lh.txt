## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: `(b | !a) & X (d U c)`

## 2: Break down the formula into its components
- `(b | !a)` means `b` is true or `a` is false in the current state.
- `X (d U c)` means that in the next state, `d` must be true until `c` becomes true.

## 3: Analyze `X (d U c)`
- `d U c` means `d` must be true in every state until `c` becomes true.
- `X` imposes this condition on the next state, meaning from the next state onwards, `d` must be true until `c` becomes true.

## 4: Combine the components
- The formula requires that in the current state, either `b` is true or `a` is false.
- And, starting from the next state, `d` must be true until `c` becomes true.

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula `(b | !a) & X (d U c)` can be translated to: 
- "In the current state, either `b` must be true or `a` must be false. 
- Starting from the very next state, `d` must be true in every state until `c` becomes true."

## 6: Specify satisfaction and constraints
- The formula is satisfied if in the current state `(b | !a)` is true and from the next state onwards, `d` remains true until `c` is true.
- It imposes a constraint on `a` and `b` in the current state and on `d` and `c` from the next state onwards.

## 7: Describe evaluation and evolution
- At the moment of checking, only `(b | !a)` is evaluated.
- The truth value evolves as the system moves forward, requiring `d U c` to hold from the next state.

## 8: Distinguish between immediate satisfaction and ongoing constraints
- Immediate satisfaction: `(b | !a)` in the current state.
- Ongoing constraints: `d` must be true until `c` becomes true, starting from the next state.

## 9: Address satisfying and violating sequences
- Satisfying sequence: Current state satisfies `(b | !a)`, and subsequent states satisfy `d U c`.
- Violating sequence: Fails `(b | !a)` in the current state or fails `d U c` from the next state.

## 10: Highlight potential misunderstandings
- The constraint `d U c` starts from the next state, not the current state.

The final answer is: 
`(b | !a) & X (d U c)` 

"In the current state, either `b` must be true or `a` must be false. From the very next state onwards, `d` must be true in every state until `c` becomes true."
