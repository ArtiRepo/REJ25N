- Original LTL formula: `t => (x & y)`

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom:
  - `x & y` means both `x` and `y` must be true in the current state.
  - `t => (x & y)` implies that if `t` is true, then both `x` and `y` must be true.

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  "If `t` is true, then both `x` and `y` must be true in the current state. If `t` is false, there are no constraints imposed on `x` and `y` by this formula."
