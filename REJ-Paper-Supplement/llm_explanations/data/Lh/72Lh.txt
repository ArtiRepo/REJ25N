- Original LTL formula: G !a

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom:
  - !a: "a must be false in the current state."
  - G: "must hold in every state of the execution."

- Combining the meaning: 
  - G !a: "a must be false in every state of the execution."

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  - "a must be false at all times, and this constraint applies in every state, with no exceptions." 

This formula imposes a constant constraint on variable a, requiring it to be false in the current state and in all future states. It is satisfied only if a remains false throughout the execution and is violated as soon as a becomes true.
