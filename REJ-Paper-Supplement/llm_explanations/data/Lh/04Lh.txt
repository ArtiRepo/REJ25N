## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: $b | !X a$

## 2: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- $X a$ means "a must be true in the very next state."
- $!X a$ means "it is not the case that a must be true in the very next state," or equivalently, "a can be false in the very next state."
- $b | !X a$ means "either b is true in the current state, or a can be false in the very next state."

## 3: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula $b | !X a$ can be translated to: "Either b is true now, or a is not required to be true in the next state."

## 4: Explain satisfaction and constraints
- The formula is satisfied if b is true in the current state, regardless of the values of a in any state.
- If b is false in the current state, the formula is satisfied if a can be false in the next state.
- The formula imposes a constraint only when b is false; in this case, it requires that a does not necessarily have to be true in the next state.

## 5: Describe evaluation and evolution of truth value
- At the moment of checking, if b is true, the formula is immediately satisfied with no further constraints on a.
- If b is false, the truth of the formula depends on the possibility of a being false in the next state, imposing a constraint that lasts for one step.

## 6: Distinguish between immediate satisfaction and ongoing constraints
- Immediate satisfaction occurs if b is true in the current state.
- Ongoing constraints apply if b is false, allowing a to potentially be false in the next state but not imposing any further constraints after that.

## 7: Address satisfying and violating sequences
- A satisfying sequence: If b is true in the current state, the sequence satisfies the formula regardless of future states.
- A violating sequence: If b is false and a must be true in the next state, the sequence violates the formula.

## 8: Highlight potential misunderstandings
A potential misunderstanding is that if b is false, there's no constraint on a being true after the next state; the only constraint is on the immediate next state.

The final answer is: $\boxed{b | !X a}$
