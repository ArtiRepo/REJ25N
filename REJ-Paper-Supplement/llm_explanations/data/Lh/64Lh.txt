- Original LTL formula: G(a -> XXXa)

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom:
  - XXXa means "a must be true three states from now."
  - a -> XXXa means "if a is true in the current state, then a must be true three states from now."
  - G(a -> XXXa) means "it must always be the case that if a is true in the current state, then a must be true three states from now."

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  "Whenever a is true, it must remain true three states later, and this condition must hold indefinitely." 

or more concisely:
  "Whenever a is true, a must be true again three steps later, and this requirement persists over all states."
