- Original LTL formula: F (o | u)

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom of the tree up:
  - The formula contains a disjunction (or) between o and u: o | u
  - The disjunction is under the scope of the Future operator F, meaning that at least one of o or u must be true in some future state.

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  "At least one of o or u must become true at some point in the future." 

This phrasing implies that the formula F (o | u) is satisfied if there exists at least one future state where either o or u (or both) is true. It does not constrain the current state but imposes a requirement that at least one of o or u must be true at some point in the future.
