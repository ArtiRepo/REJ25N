## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: `(a U b) & (c U d)`

## 2: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Breaking down the formula into its components:
- `a U b` means "b must eventually become true, and until that specific moment, a must remain true in every state."
- `c U d` means "d must eventually become true, and until that specific moment, c must remain true in every state."
The conjunction `&` means both conditions must be satisfied.

## 3: Analyze `a U b`
- For `a U b` to be true, `b` must become true at some point in the future.
- Until `b` becomes true, `a` must be true in every state.
- Once `b` becomes true, the constraint on `a` no longer applies.

## 4: Analyze `c U d`
- For `c U d` to be true, `d` must become true at some point in the future.
- Until `d` becomes true, `c` must be true in every state.
- Once `d` becomes true, the constraint on `c` no longer applies.

## 5: Combine the conditions with conjunction
- Both `a U b` and `c U d` must be true.
- This means both `b` and `d` must eventually become true.
- Until `b` becomes true, `a` must be true; until `d` becomes true, `c` must be true.
- The constraints on `a` and `c` cease once `b` and `d` become true, respectively.

## 6: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula `(a U b) & (c U d)` can be translated to: "Both conditions must be met: a must be true until b becomes true, and c must be true until d becomes true. Both b and d must become true at some point in the future."

## 7: Specify satisfaction and constraints
- The formula is satisfied if both `b` and `d` become true, with `a` and `c` holding until then, respectively.
- It imposes constraints on `a` and `c` until `b` and `d` are true, respectively, but not after.

## 8: Describe evaluation and evolution of truth value
- At the moment of checking, the formula's truth value depends on the current states of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, and their future realizations.
- Over time, as `b` and `d` become true, the constraints on `a` and `c` are lifted.

The final answer is: 
`(a U b) & (c U d)` translates to: "a must be true until b becomes true, and c must be true until d becomes true, with both b and d becoming true at some point in the future."
