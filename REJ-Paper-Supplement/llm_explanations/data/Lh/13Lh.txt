## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: `(c U a) & (b U a)`

## 2: Break down the Until (U) operators
To understand the formula, we first break down the Until operators:
- `c U a` means "a must eventually become true, and until that specific moment, c must remain true in every state."
- `b U a` means "a must eventually become true, and until that specific moment, b must remain true in every state."

## 3: Combine the meanings of the Until operators with conjunction
The conjunction `&` means both conditions must be satisfied:
- Both `c U a` and `b U a` must be true.
- This implies that `a` must eventually become true for both conditions to be satisfied.
- Until `a` becomes true, both `c` and `b` must be true in every state.

## 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula `(c U a) & (b U a)` can be translated to: "Both `c` and `b` must be true until `a` becomes true, at which point `a` must remain true. Alternatively, more naturally: `a` must eventually be true, and both `b` and `c` must be true in all states before `a` becomes true."

## 5: Clarify constraints and satisfaction
- The formula imposes a constraint that both `b` and `c` must be true in every state until `a` becomes true.
- Once `a` becomes true, the constraints on `b` and `c` cease to apply, and `a` must remain true thereafter to satisfy the formula in a minimal interpretation, though the Until operator itself doesn't explicitly require `a` to stay true, the conjunction of two Until conditions with `a` as the end condition implies `a`'s truth is necessary for satisfaction.

The final answer is: 
(c U a) & (b U a)

- Rebuilt meaning: "a must be true eventually. Until a is true, both b and c must be true."
- Refined phrasing: "Both b and c must hold true in all states until a becomes true, at which point a must be true."
