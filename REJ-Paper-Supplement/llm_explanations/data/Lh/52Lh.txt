- Original LTL formula: XXFXa

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:
  - FXa: "There must exist at least one future state where a is true, and it must become true at some point after the current state."
  - X(FXa): "In the next state, there must exist a future state where a is true."
  - XX(FXa): "In two states from now, there must exist a future state where a is true."

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  "Two steps from now, a must become true at some point in the future." 

This formula imposes a constraint on variable 'a' but does so in a way that is delayed. It does not require 'a' to be true immediately or even in the next state, but it does necessitate that 'a' becomes true at some point after two states from the current one. If 'a' becomes true before or at the second state from now, the formula remains satisfied without further constraints. The critical constraint applies specifically from the state two steps from the current one, requiring 'a' to be true at some point thereafter.
