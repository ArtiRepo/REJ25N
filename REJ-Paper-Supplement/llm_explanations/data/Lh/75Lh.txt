- Original LTL formula: F(a and b)

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom:
  - "a and b" means both a and b must be true.
  - F(x) means "there must exist at least one future state where x is true."

- Combining: F(a and b) means there must exist at least one future state where both a and b are true.

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  "At some point in the future, both a and b must be true simultaneously." 

  - This formula imposes a constraint on the system over time, requiring that at least once, both a and b are true in the same state.
  - It does not constrain a and b to be true before or after this state, only that there exists a future state where both are true.
  - Satisfaction: The formula is satisfied if there is at least one state in the future where both a and b are true.
  - Violation: The formula is violated if in all future states, either a or b (or both) are false.
