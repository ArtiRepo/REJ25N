- Original LTL formula: G t | F w

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:
  - F w: "There must exist at least one future state where w is true."
  - G t: "t must be true in every state of the execution."
  - The formula combines these with a disjunction (|), so we need to consider the disjunction's impact.

- Refined natural language phrasing:
  - "Either t is always true, or there will be a future state where w is true." 
  - More naturally: "The system must either maintain t as true in all states or reach a state where w is true at some point in the future."

This phrasing captures the essence of the LTL formula, specifying that the system is constrained to either always have t true or eventually have w true, with no further constraints on variables beyond this requirement.
