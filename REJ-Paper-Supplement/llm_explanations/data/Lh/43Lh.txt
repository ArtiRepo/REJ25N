- Original LTL formula: X (f & i)

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom:
  - (f & i) means "f must be true in the current state and i must be true in the current state."
  - X (f & i) means "in the very next state, (f & i) must hold."

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  "In the immediate next state, both f and i must be true." 

This formula imposes a constraint on the variables f and i, but only in the state immediately following the current one. It does not constrain the current state or any state beyond the next one. 

Satisfying sequence: A sequence where f and i are both true in the state immediately following the current state satisfies this formula, regardless of the values of f and i in the current state or beyond.

Violating sequence: A sequence where f or i (or both) is false in the state immediately following the current state violates this formula.
