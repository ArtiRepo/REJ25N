- Original LTL formula: G(a→b)

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom:
  - a→b means "if a is true, then b must be true." 
  - G implies that this condition must hold in every state.

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  "Whenever a is true, b must be true, and this condition must hold in every state of the execution." 

  or more naturally: 
  "Whenever a is true, b must also be true, and this must be the case at all times." 

  This can be further simplified to: 
  "If a is ever true, then b must be true now and remain so as long as a is true, and this condition holds forever."
