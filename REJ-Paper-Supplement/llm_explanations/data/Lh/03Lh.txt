- Original LTL formula: `a & X b`

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom of the tree up:
  - `X b` means "b must be true in the very next state."
  - `a` means "a must be true in the current state and is otherwise unconstrained."
  - The conjunction `&` requires both conditions to be satisfied simultaneously.

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  "a must be true now, and b must be true in the next state." 

This formula imposes a constraint on `a` in the current state and on `b` in the immediate next state, with no further constraints on `a` or `b` beyond that point. It is satisfied if `a` is true now and `b` is true in the next state, with no requirements on subsequent states. If `a` is false in the current state or `b` is false in the next state, the formula is violated.
