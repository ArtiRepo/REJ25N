- Original LTL formula: XXXa

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom of the tree up:
  - X(a) means "a must be true in the very next state."
  - XX(a) means "a must be true in the state after the very next state," or equivalently, "a must be true two steps from now."
  - XXX(a) means "a must be true three steps from now."

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  "a must be true three steps from now, with no constraints on the current or the next two states."
