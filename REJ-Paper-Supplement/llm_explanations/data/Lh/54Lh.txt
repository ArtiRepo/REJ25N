## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: `(a U b) ∧ G(a)`.

## 2: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
First, break down `G(a)`: "a must be true in every state of the execution."

## 3: Analyze `a U b`
`a U b` means: "b must eventually become true, and until that specific moment, a must remain true in every state."

## 4: Combine `a U b` and `G(a)`
Since `G(a)` requires `a` to be true in every state and `a U b` requires `a` to be true until `b` becomes true, combining them with `∧` (and) implies that `a` must be true in every state and `b` must eventually become true while `a` holds until then.

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula `(a U b) ∧ G(a)` implies: "a must be true in all states, and there exists a future state where b becomes true, with a holding true until b does."

## 6: Clarify constraints and satisfaction
This formula is satisfied if `a` is always true and `b` becomes true at some point in the future. It imposes a constraint that `a` must never be false and `b` must eventually be true.

## 7: Describe evaluation and evolution of truth value
At the moment of checking, the formula's truth value depends on the current state of `a` and the future realization of `b`. Over time, if `a` remains true and `b` eventually becomes true, the formula is satisfied. If `a` becomes false or `b` never becomes true, the formula is violated.

## 8: Distinguish between immediate satisfaction and ongoing constraints
Immediate satisfaction requires `a` to be true. Ongoing constraints require `a` to remain true and for `b` to eventually become true.

## 9: Address satisfying and violating sequences
A satisfying sequence: `a` is true initially and remains true until `b` becomes true. A violating sequence: if `a` becomes false at any point or if `b` never becomes true while `a` is true.

## 10: Final translation
The LTL formula `(a U b) ∧ G(a)` translates to: "a must always be true, and b must become true at some point in the future, with a being true until b becomes true." 

The final answer is: 
- Original LTL formula: (a U b) ∧ G(a)
- Meaning: a must be true in all states and b must eventually become true while a holds until then.
- Natural Language Translation: "a must always be true, and there must exist a future state where b becomes true, with a holding true until b does."
