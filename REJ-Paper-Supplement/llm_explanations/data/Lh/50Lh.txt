- Original LTL formula: F (o U u)

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom:
  - o U u: "u must eventually become true, and until that specific moment, o must remain true in every state."
  - F (o U u): "There must exist at least one future state where o U u is true."

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  "There will be a future state where u becomes true, and from now until then, o must be true." 

or more naturally:
  "o must be true until u becomes true at some point in the future."

This phrasing highlights that:
- The formula imposes a constraint on both o and u.
- o must be true in all states until u becomes true.
- Once u becomes true, the constraint on o no longer applies.
- The formula is satisfied if there exists at least one future state where u is true and o is true in all preceding states.
