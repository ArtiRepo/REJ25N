## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: `(d U c) | (a U !c)`

## 2: Break down the formula into its components
The formula consists of two main parts connected by a disjunction (`|`):
1. `d U c`
2. `a U !c`

## 3: Interpret the first part, `d U c`
- `d U c` means: "c must eventually become true, and until that specific moment, d must remain true in every state."

## 4: Interpret the second part, `a U !c`
- `a U !c` means: "!c must eventually become true (meaning c must become false), and until that specific moment, a must remain true in every state."

## 5: Combine the interpretations with the disjunction
- The entire formula `(d U c) | (a U !c)` is satisfied if either of the two parts is satisfied.

## 6: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
- The formula is satisfied if either: 
  - "c becomes true, and until then, d is true in every state,"
  - or "c becomes false, and until then, a is true in every state."

## 7: Describe satisfaction and constraints over time
- The formula imposes constraints on the system over time, requiring either d to be true until c becomes true or a to be true until c becomes false.
- It does not constrain variables when the respective condition is met (e.g., once c is true, d no longer needs to be true).

## 8: Address potential misunderstandings
- A key point is that the constraints (d being true or a being true) only apply until the condition (c being true or c being false) is met.

The final answer is: 
(d U c) | (a U !c)

The formula `(d U c) | (a U !c)` can be translated to: 
"The system satisfies this formula if either c will eventually be true and d remains true until then, or c will eventually be false and a remains true until then."
