- Original LTL formula: X (!i) | X (j)

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:
  - X (!i) means "in the very next state, i must be false."
  - X (j) means "in the very next state, j must be true."
  - The disjunction (|) implies that at least one of the conditions must be satisfied.

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  "In the very next state, either i must be false or j must be true (or both)."
