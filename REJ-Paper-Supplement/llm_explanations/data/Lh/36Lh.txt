- Original LTL formula: G (j => !f)

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom:
  - j => !f: "If j is true, then f must be false."
  - G (j => !f): This applies the "always" operator (G) to the implication.

- Refined natural language phrasing:
  "It must always be the case that if j is true, then f is false."

This translates to: 
- At any point in time, if j is true, f must be false immediately and this constraint applies continuously.
- The formula does not impose a constraint on f when j is false.
- A violating sequence would be any point in time where j is true and f is also true.
- A satisfying sequence would be any where j being true is always accompanied by f being false.
