- Original LTL formula: `a U !a`

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom:
  - `!a` means "a must be false in the current state."
  - `U` operator indicates a two-phase behavior: 
    - The first phase requires `a` to be true until...
    - ...the second phase where `!a` becomes true.

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  "a must be true in every state until a specific future moment when a becomes false, and from that moment onwards, a must be false." 

or more concisely:
"a must hold true in all states until it eventually becomes false, at which point the requirement for a to be true ceases."
