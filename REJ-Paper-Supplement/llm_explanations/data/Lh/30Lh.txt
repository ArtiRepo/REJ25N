- Original LTL formula: X a & !G b

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom:
  - !G b: This means that it is not the case that b must be true in every state. Therefore, !G b implies that there must exist at least one state where b is false.
  - X a: This means that a must be true in the very next state.

- Combining the meanings:
  The formula X a & !G b can be understood as: "a must be true in the next state, and there must exist at least one state where b is false."

- Refined natural language phrasing:
  "In the immediate next state, a must be true. Furthermore, b does not need to be true in every state; there must be at least one state where b is false. The truth of a is only constrained in the very next state, while the constraint on b applies over the entire execution, allowing for at least one false instance."
