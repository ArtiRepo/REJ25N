- Original LTL formula: a U c

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom:
  - The formula "a U c" implies two main components: 
    1. "c must become true at some point in the future."
    2. "Until c becomes true, a must be true in every state."

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  "c must eventually become true, and until that moment, a must remain true in every state."
