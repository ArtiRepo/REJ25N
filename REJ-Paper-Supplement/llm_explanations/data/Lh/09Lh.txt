- Original LTL formula: `(c & b) U a`

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom of the tree up:
  - `a` must become true at some point in the future.
  - Until `a` becomes true, `c & b` must be true.

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  "`a` must eventually become true, and until that moment, both `b` and `c` must be true in every state."
