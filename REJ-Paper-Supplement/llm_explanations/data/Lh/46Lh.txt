- Original LTL formula: F d | G !n

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom of the tree up:
  - F d: "There must exist at least one future state where d is true."
  - G !n: "n must be false in every state of the execution."
  - The formula combines these with a disjunction (|), so the overall formula is satisfied if either part is satisfied.

- Refined natural language phrasing:
  "Either there will be a future state where d is true, or n must remain false forever." 

This phrasing captures the essence of the disjunction between a future requirement (F d) and a persistent constraint (G !n), highlighting when the formula is satisfied and the nature of its constraints over time.
