- Original LTL formula: b U (a | d)

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom:
  - a | d: "Either a or d (or both) must be true in the current state."
  - b U (a | d): Break down into two phases:
    - "a | d must eventually become true."
    - "Until a | d becomes true, b must remain true in every state."

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  "b must be true in every state until either a or d (or both) becomes true, at which point b no longer needs to hold, but it is not required to become false either; the only requirement is that one of a or d must be true at some point in the future."
