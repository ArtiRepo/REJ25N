## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: `!F(a and Xa and XXa)`

## 2: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Starting from the bottom:
- `XXa` means `a` must be true two states from now.
- `Xa` means `a` must be true in the next state.
- `a and Xa and XXa` means `a` must be true now, in the next state, and two states from now.

## 3: Understanding `F(a and Xa and XXa)`
- `F(a and Xa and XXa)` means there must exist a state in the future where `a` is true now, in the next state, and two states from now.

## 4: Understanding the negation `!F(a and Xa and XXa)`
- `!F(a and Xa and XXa)` means it must not be the case that there exists a state in the future where `a` is true now, in the next state, and two states from now.

## 5: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
- The formula `!F(a and Xa and XXa)` can be translated to: "It must not be possible to find a point in the future where `a` is true continuously for three states, including the current state and the two states immediately following it."

## 6: Clarify constraints and satisfaction
- This formula imposes a constraint that there cannot be three consecutive states where `a` is true.
- It does not constrain `a` to be true or false in the current state but imposes a condition on future states.

## 7: Describe evaluation and evolution of truth value
- At the moment of checking, the formula's truth value depends on future states.
- The formula is satisfied if, at any point, the condition of having three consecutive true values for `a` is avoided.

## 8: Distinguish between immediate satisfaction and ongoing constraints
- Immediate satisfaction depends on the current and future states of `a`.
- Ongoing constraints apply as the system evolves, ensuring the condition is never met.

The final answer is: 
!F(a and Xa and XXa) translates to: "It must not be possible to find a point in the future where `a` is true continuously for three states, including the current state and the two states immediately following it."
