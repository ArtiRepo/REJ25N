- Original LTL formula: G a

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom of the tree up:
  - The formula G a involves the temporal operator G, which stands for "always" or "globally."
  - G a means that a must be true in every state of the execution.

- Refined natural language phrasing for clarity: 
  "a must be true in every state of the execution, from the current state and indefinitely into the future." 

This phrasing emphasizes that the constraint applies immediately and continuously over time, with no relaxation of the condition that "a" must hold true.
