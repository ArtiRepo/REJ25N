- Original LTL formula: b U (d & a)

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom:
  - (d & a) means both d and a must be true in the same state.
  - Focusing on U: For b U (d & a), once (d & a) becomes true, b can be false or true; the constraint is on b before (d & a) is satisfied.

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  "b must be true until the state where both d and a are true, at which point b can become false or remain true."
