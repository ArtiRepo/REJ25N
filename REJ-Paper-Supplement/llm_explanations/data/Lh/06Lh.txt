- Original LTL formula: X !b & d

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom:
  - The formula contains two main parts: !b and d.
  - !b means "b must be false."
  - d means "d must be true."
  - The conjunction (&) of !b and d means both must be true.
  - X (next) operator applies to the conjunction, meaning this condition must be true in the very next state.

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  "In the very next state, b must be false and d must be true."

This phrasing specifies that the formula imposes a constraint on variables b and d for the next state but does not constrain them for the current or any future state beyond the immediate next one. The formula is satisfied if, in the next state, b is false and d is true. If either condition is not met in the next state, the formula is violated. There are no ongoing constraints after the next state.
