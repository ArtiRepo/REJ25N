- Original LTL formula: G(a → X!b)

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom of the tree up:
  - X!b: "b must be false in the very next state."
  - a → X!b: "If a is true in the current state, then b must be false in the very next state."
  - G(a → X!b): "For every state, if a is true in that state, then b must be false in the very next state."

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  "Whenever a is true, b must be false in the immediate next state, and this condition must hold in every state of the execution." 

This phrasing clarifies that the constraint of b being false in the next state only applies when a is true and that this relationship must consistently hold across all states.
