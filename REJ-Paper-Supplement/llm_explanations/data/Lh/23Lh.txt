- Original LTL formula: t => w

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:
  - The formula is a conditional statement: "if t then w".
  - This can be rewritten as: !t ∨ w.

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  "Whenever t is true, w must also be true. However, if t is false, there is no constraint on w." or equivalently, 
  "If t holds, then w must hold; but if t does not hold, w may or may not hold." 

This translation highlights that the formula imposes a constraint on the variables only when t is true, requiring w to be true in that case. If t is false, there is no constraint imposed on w.
