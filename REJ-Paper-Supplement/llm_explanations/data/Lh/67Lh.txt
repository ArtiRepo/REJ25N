- Original LTL formula: XXFa

- Rebuilding meaning from the bottom of the tree up:
  - Fa: "There must exist at least one future state where a is true."
  - X(Fa): "In the very next state, there must exist some future state (not necessarily the same one) where a is true."
  - XXFa: "In the state after next, there must exist at least one future state where a is true."

- Refined natural language phrasing: 
  "It is required that from the state two steps from now, there will be at least one state in the future where a is true." 

This phrasing clarifies that the formula imposes a constraint on the system two steps into the future, requiring that from that point onwards, there must be a state where a is true. It does not constrain the current state or the immediate next state regarding the truth of a, but it does impose a condition that a must be satisfied at some point after the second state.
