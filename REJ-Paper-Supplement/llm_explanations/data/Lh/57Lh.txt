## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: F(a) ∧ G(a → XG¬a)

## Step 2: Break down the formula into its components
The formula consists of two main parts: F(a) and G(a → XG¬a). 
- F(a) means "There must exist at least one future state where a is true."
- G(a → XG¬a) means "Always, if a is true, then in the next state, it must always be that a is false."

## 3: Analyze the second part, G(a → XG¬a)
- a → XG¬a means "If a is true, then in the next state, it must always be that a is false."
- XG¬a means "In the next state, a must be false in all subsequent states."

## 4: Combine the understanding of both parts
- F(a) indicates that a must become true at least once.
- G(a → XG¬a) indicates that whenever a becomes true, it must be false from the next state onwards and remain false.

## 5: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
- For G(a → XG¬a), if a is true, then immediately after, a must be false and stay false. This implies that once a is true, it cannot be true again.
- F(a) requires a to be true at some point.

## 6: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula F(a) ∧ G(a → XG¬a) can be translated to: "There must exist a state where a is true, and whenever a is true, it must become and remain false from the next state onwards."

## 7: Describe satisfaction and constraints
- The formula is satisfied if a becomes true at least once and then remains false.
- It imposes a constraint that once a is true, it cannot become true again.

## 8: Distinguish between immediate satisfaction and ongoing constraints
- Immediate satisfaction: a being true at some point satisfies F(a).
- Ongoing constraint: After a is true, it must remain false, imposed by G(a → XG¬a).

The final answer is: 
Fa: "a must be true at least once in the future."
G(a -> XG!a): "Whenever a is true, from the next state onwards, a must be false in all states."
 Combined: "The system must have at least one state where a is true, and from the moment a becomes true, a must be false forever after."
