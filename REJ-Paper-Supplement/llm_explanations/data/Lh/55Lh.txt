## Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula
The original LTL formula is: G(a -> (X!a and XXa))

## 2: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up
Breaking down the formula:
- `XXa` means "a must be true two states from now".
- `X!a` means "not a must be true in the very next state".
- `X!a and XXa` means "not a must be true in the next state, and a must be true two states from now".
- `a -> (X!a and XXa)` means "if a is true now, then not a must be true in the next state, and a must be true two states from now".
- `G(a -> (X!a and XXa))` means "it is always the case that if a is true now, then not a must be true in the next state, and a must be true two states from now".

## 3: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity
The formula `G(a -> (X!a and XXa))` can be translated to: "Whenever a is true, it must immediately become false in the next state, and then become true again two states later. This pattern must hold indefinitely for any state where a is true."

This imposes a constraint on variable `a` whenever `a` is true, specifying a precise pattern of change over time: a must toggle off and on with a delay. If `a` is false, there are no immediate constraints imposed by this formula, but the formula's satisfaction depends on future states where `a` might become true. 

The formula is satisfied if and only if, whenever `a` is true, it becomes false in the next state and then true two states after that, repeating this pattern indefinitely. It is violated if `a` is true and this toggling pattern does not occur. 

For sequences:
- Satisfying sequence: `a, false, a, false, a, ...` 
- Violating sequence: `a, a, false, false, ...` or `a, false, false, ...`

The constraints apply specifically when `a` is true and dictate a specific future pattern for `a`.
