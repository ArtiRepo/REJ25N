### Translation of LTL Formula: `FGa`  
**Original formula:** `FGa`  
(Equivalent to `F(G(a))` after parsing)

---

#### Step 1: Parsing Tree (Breakdown)  
- **Leaf node:** `a`  
  - *Meaning:* "`a` is true in the current state" (atomic proposition).  
- **Intermediate node:** `G(a)`  
  - *Structure:* `G` (Globally operator) applied to `a`.  
- **Root node:** `F(G(a))`  
  - *Structure:* `F` (Finally operator) applied to `G(a)`.  

---

#### Step 2: Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up  
1. **Meaning of `a`:**  
   - "`a` holds (is true) in a specific state."  

2. **Meaning of `G(a)`:**  
   - "`a` holds **in every state of the entire execution**."  
   - *Constraint:* This requires `a` to be true in the current state and all future states without exception.  

3. **Meaning of `F(G(a))`:**  
   - The `F` operator applied to `G(a)` shifts focus to a **future starting point**.  
   - "There exists **some future state `s`** such that `G(a)` is satisfied **from `s` onward**."  
   - This means:  
     - `a` does **not** need to hold immediately or in all initial states.  
     - At a **specific future state `s`**, `a` becomes true, **and then `a` remains true in every state after `s`.**

#### Step 3: Refined Natural Language Translation  
> "**Eventually, `a` becomes permanently true.**"  
>   
> **Explanation:**  
> - *Satisfaction condition:* There must be a **finite point in time** after which `a` is **always true** for the rest of the execution.  
> - *Constraints over time:*  
>   - Before this point, `a` may be `true` or `false` arbitrarily.  
>   - After this point, `a` **cannot be false in any subsequent state**.  
> - *Negation insight:*  
>   `¬(FGa)` means "`a` never stabilizes to `true` forever" (i.e., `a` is false infinitely often).

### Key Implications  
- **Example valid execution:**  
  States: `[a=False, a=False, a=True, a=True, a=True, ...]`  
  *Reason:* At state 3, `a` becomes true and **stays true forever after**.  
- **Example invalid execution:**  
  States: `[a=True, a=False, a=True, a=False, ...]` (alternates forever)  
  *Reason:* No point exists after which `a` is always true.  

This formula describes **eventual stabilization** of `a` to `true`.
