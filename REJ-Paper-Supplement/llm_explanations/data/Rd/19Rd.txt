### Translation of the LTL Formula: **F (!y & w)**  

#### Step 1: Original Formula  
`F (!y & w)`  

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
- **Top-level operator:** `F` (Eventually)  
  - **Argument:** A conjunction `(!y & w)`  
    - **Left operand:** `!y` (Negation of atomic proposition `y`)  
    - **Right operand:** `w` (Atomic proposition)  

Visual tree representation:  
```
     F  
     |  
    AND  
    /  \  
  NOT   w  
  |  
  y  
```

#### Step 3: Bottom-Up Meaning Reconstruction  
1. **Atomic proposition `w`:**  
   - "`w` must be true in the current state."  
2. **Negation `!y`:**  
   - "`y` must be false in the current state."  
3. **Conjunction `(!y & w)`:**  
   - "Both conditions must hold *in the same state*: `w` is true and `y` is false."  
   - *Interpretation:* A state where `w` holds and `y` does **not** hold.  
4. **Eventually `F(!y & w)`:**  
   - "There exists **at least one future state (including the present)** where `(!y & w)` is satisfied."  
   - *Constraint:* The system must exhibit a state where `w` is true and `y` is false at least once.  

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Phrasing  
> "**Eventually, at some point in time, `w` holds and `y` is false simultaneously.**"  

#### Key Explanations:  
- **When satisfied?**  
  The formula is satisfied if the system has *any* state (current or future) where `w` is true and `y` is false.  
  Example: If `w` is true and `y` is false at time step 3, the formula holds regardless of other states.  
- **Constraints imposed:**  
  - The system **must** eventually satisfy `w ∧ ¬y`.  
  - No restrictions apply to `y` or `w` outside this state:  
    - `y` may be true/false arbitrarily before or after this state.  
    - `w` may be true/false at other times except at the required state.  
  - If this state never occurs (i.e., whenever `w` is true, `y` is *also* true, or `w` never holds), the formula is violated.  

#### Final Translation:  
"**The system must eventually reach a state where `w` is true and `y` is false.**"  

This phrase emphasizes the simultaneous truth of `w` and falsehood of `y` in a single state, which is the core requirement of `F (!y & w)`.
