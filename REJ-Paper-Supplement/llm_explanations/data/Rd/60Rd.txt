### Translation of the LTL Formula: \( G(a \rightarrow Fb) \)

#### Step 1: Original Formula
\[ \boxed{G(a \rightarrow Fb)} \]

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown
```
      G( ... )          [Global operator]
        |
        →
       / \
      a   Fb           [Implication: a implies Fb]
           |
           b           [Fb: Eventually b]
```

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up
1. **Innermost subformula \( b \)**  
   - Semantics: Evaluates to `true` if `b` holds in the **current state**.  

2. **Subformula \( Fb \)**  
   - Semantics: "There exists at least one future state (including the current state) where \( b \) is true."  
   - Constraints:  
     - \( b \) must hold **at least once** in the current or future states.  

3. **Subformula \( a \rightarrow Fb \)**  
   - Semantics: "If \( a \) is true in the current state, then \( Fb \) must also be true (i.e., \( b \) must eventually hold)."  
   - Constraints:  
     - If \( a \) is true **now**, the system must guarantee \( b \) becomes true **at or after the current state**.  
     - If \( a \) is false **now**, the implication automatically holds (no constraint imposed).  

4. **Full formula \( G(a \rightarrow Fb) \)**  
   - Semantics: "The condition \( (a \rightarrow Fb) \) must hold **in every state** of the execution."  
   - Constraints:  
     - **For every state** \( s_i \) in the execution:  
       - If \( a \) is true at \( s_i \), then \( b \) must be true at some state \( s_j \) where \( j \geq i \).  
     - The formula does **not** require \( b \) to hold globally or immediately after \( a \). Only **one future instance of \( b \)** is needed per occurrence of \( a \).  

#### Step 4: Natural Language Translation (Refined)
> "**Whenever \( a \) is true, \( b \) must eventually become true (either immediately or later).**"  

**Key Explanations:**  
1. **Satisfaction Condition:**  
   The formula is satisfied if, **every single time** \( a \) holds in the execution, there is **at least one corresponding occurrence of \( b \) at that moment or in the future**.  
   - Example: If \( a \) is true at times \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \), then \( b \) must appear at \( t_1 \) (same time as \( a \)), or at some \( t_3 > t_1 \) (after \( t_1 \)), **and** at \( t_2 \) or some \( t_4 > t_2 \).  

2. **Constraint on the System:**  
   - **No "Stranded \( a \)":** If \( a \) holds at any point, \( b \) **cannot be false forever afterward** relative to that point.  
   - **Behavior on \( \neg a \):** When \( a \) is false, no constraints are imposed (the system is free to behave arbitrarily).  
   - **Liveness Guarantee:** \( b \) is **required infinitely often** **only if** \( a \) holds infinitely often (otherwise, \( b \) may occur finitely).  

3. **Common Pitfalls Clarified:**  
   - \( b \) **does not need to hold globally**—only once per \( a \)-occurrence.  
   - \( a \) **can be true multiple times** without requiring distinct \( b \)-events for each (a single \( b \) may satisfy multiple \( a \)-occurrences if it occurs **after** all of them).  

**Final Natural Language Statement:**  
"**Globally, if \( a \) holds at any point, then \( b \) must hold somewhere in the future (including immediately), without exception.**"
