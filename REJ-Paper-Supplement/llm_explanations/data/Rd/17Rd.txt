### Translation and Reasoning for LTL Formula: `¬G c`

#### Step 1: Original Formula
- **LTL Formula**: `¬G c`

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown
```
    ¬   (Negation)
     |
    G   (Global operator)
     |
    c   (Atomic proposition)
```
- **Root**: Negation (`¬`)
- **Child**: Globally operator (`G`)
- **Leaf**: Atomic proposition `c`

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning (Bottom-Up)

1. **Base Case: `c`**  
   - "`c` must be true in the state where it is evaluated, with no constraints on other states."

2. **Apply `G` to `c`: `G c`**  
   - "`c` must hold **in every state** of the execution (now and always)."

3. **Apply Negation to `G c`: `¬G c`**  
   - Negation flips the meaning:  
     "It is **not true** that `c` holds in every state."  
   - Logically, this means:  
     "**There exists at least one state in the execution where `c` is false."  
     (Equivalent to `F ¬c`: "Eventually `c` becomes false.")

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Translation
- **Final Phrasing**:  
  "**`c` is not always true**; there must be **at least one state** in the execution where `c` is **false**."  

#### Key Insights:
- **Satisfaction Condition**: The formula is satisfied if the system **fails to satisfy `c` in at least one state** (even if `c` holds in most states).
- **Constraint Over Time**:  
  - No guarantee is required for `c` after the failure state.  
  - `c` may hold infinitely before the failure, but **it must eventually break** (e.g., "the system must violate `c` at least once").
- **Example**:  
  If `c` = "the system is operational", then `¬G c` requires that **the system eventually fails at least once** (though it may recover later).

#### Equivalent Form:
- `¬G c` is logically equivalent to `F ¬c`, which translates to:  
  "**Eventually, `c` becomes false.**"  
  (This concise form is also acceptable but retains the same core meaning.)
