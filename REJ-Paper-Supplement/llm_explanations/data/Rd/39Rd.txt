### Translation and Explanation of LTL Formula: `b U (d & a)`

#### Original LTL Formula:
`b U (d & a)`

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown via Parsing Tree:
We decompose the formula into its atomic components and operators:
- **Atomic propositions**: `b`, `d`, `a` (base requirements).
- **Conjunction (`&`)** in `(d & a)`: Both `d` and `a` must be true *simultaneously* in the same state.
- **Until (`U`)** (`b U ...`): The core temporal operator defining two phases.

**Parsing Tree Structure**:
- Root: `U` (Until operator)
  - Left child: `b` (proposition)
  - Right child: `&` (Conjunction)
    - Left: `d` (proposition)
    - Right: `a` (proposition)

#### Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up:
1. **Base propositions**:  
   - `b`, `d`, `a` have no temporal constraints individually. Each represents a distinct system property (e.g., "a request is pending" or "a resource is available").
   
2. **Conjunction (`d & a`)**:  
   - This subformula requires **a single future state** where `d` *and* `a` are **both true simultaneously**.  
   - Example translation: *"d and a must both hold in the same state."*

3. **Until (`b U (d & a)`)**:  
   - **Phase 1 (until `d & a` becomes true)**: `b` must hold **continuously** in **every state**, starting from the current state and continuing until **the state immediately before** the state where `d & a` becomes true.  
   - **Phase 2 (when `d & a` becomes true)**: At the precise state where `d & a` holds, `b` **is no longer required**. The formula is satisfied when this state is reached.  
   - **Eventuality guarantee**: There **must exist** a state (current or future) where `d & a` is true. If `d & a` holds now, Phase 1 is vacuous (no intermediate states exist).

#### Final Natural Language Translation:
*"d and a must eventually both become true in the same state. Until that specific moment, b must hold continuously in every state. Once d and a hold simultaneously, b is no longer required."*

### Key Clarifications:
- **Satisfaction Conditions**:  
  - The formula is **satisfied** if:  
    - There exists a state (current or future) where `d` *and* `a` are **both true**.  
    - In *every state* from the current state up to (but *not including*) the state where `d & a` becomes true, `b` holds.  
  - If `d & a` is true *now*, `b` is **not required** in the current state (no prior states exist).  
    
- **Constraints Over Time**:  
  - If `d & a` holds immediately, `b` is unconstrained.  
  - If `d & a` holds later, `b` must **persist until the state before** `d & a` becomes true.  
  - If `d & a` *never* holds, the formula is **violated**, regardless of `b`.  
    
- **Edge Cases**:  
  - **Both true now**: `d & a` holds immediately → valid, even if `b` is false now.  
  - **Future occurrence**: If `d & a` holds at time `k`, `b` must hold at times `0` to `k-1` (if `k>0`).  

#### Example Execution:
```
States: [0, 1, 2, 3]
- Assume d & a first holds at state 2.
- Requirement: 
  - State 0: b = true  
  - State 1: b = true  
  - State 2: d = true AND a = true (b can be true or false here).
