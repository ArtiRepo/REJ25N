### Translation of the LTL Formula: **F a ∧ G(a → X G ¬a)**

#### Step 1: Original Formula
- **Formula**: \( \text{F } a \land \text{G}(a \rightarrow \text{X } \text{G } \neg a) \)

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown
- **Top-level operator**: Conjunction (`∧`):
  - **Left operand**: \( \text{F } a \) ("Eventually \( a \)")
  - **Right operand**: \( \text{G}(a \rightarrow \text{X } \text{G } \neg a) \) ("Globally, if \( a \) holds, then next, globally \( \neg a \) holds")
- **Breakdown of \( a \rightarrow \text{X } \text{G } \neg a \)**:
  - **Implication**: If \( a \) is true (in a state), then \( \text{X } \text{G } \neg a \) must hold.
  - **Next operator (\( \text{X } \))**: In the **immediate next state**, \( \text{G } \neg a \) must hold.
  - **Globally (\( \text{G } \))**: **From that next state onward**, \( \neg a \) (i.e., \( a \) is false) must hold everywhere.

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up
1. **Innermost subformula**: \( \text{G } \neg a \)  
   - *Meaning*: \( a \) must be false **for all states** starting from the target state onward.
   
2. **Next layer**: \( \text{X } \text{G } \neg a \)  
   - *Meaning*: In the **very next state**, \( a \) must become false **and remain false forever**.

3. **Implication**: \( a \rightarrow \text{X } \text{G } \neg a \)  
   - *Meaning*: **If \( a \) is true in a state**, then **starting from the next state**, \( a \) **must be false eternally**.  
   - If \( a \) is false, the implication vacuously holds (no constraint).

4. **Global operator**: \( \text{G}(a \rightarrow \text{X } \text{G } \neg a) \)  
   - *Meaning*: **In every state**, the above implication must hold. Thus, **whenever \( a \) becomes true**, it must be followed **immediately** by eternal falsehood of \( a \).

5. **Eventually operator**: \( \text{F } a \)  
   - *Meaning*: \( a \) **must be true in at least one future state**.

6. **Conjunction**: \( \text{F } a \land \text{G}(a \rightarrow \text{X } \text{G } \neg a) \)  
   - *Combined meaning*:  
     - There exists **at least one state where \( a \) is true** (from \( \text{F } a \)).  
     - For **any state where \( a \) is true**, the **next state and all thereafter must have \( a \) false** (from \( \text{G}(a \rightarrow \text{X } \text{G } \neg a) \)).  

#### Key Deductions for Combined Formula:
- If \( a \) holds at a state \( i \), then from state \( i+1 \) onward, \( a \) is **never** true again.  
- If \( a \) were true **again later** (e.g., at state \( j > i \)), it would violate \( \text{G } \neg a \) enforced at \( i+1 \).  
- Thus, \( a \) **can only be true once** (it cannot reoccur later).  
- \( \text{F } a \) ensures this single occurrence **must exist**.  
- **States before the \( a \)-state**:  
  - If \( a \) were true **before** this state, the same rule would activate, forcing \( a \) false afterward and preventing the later occurrence.  
  - Thus, **all states before** the \( a \)-state **must have \( a \) false** (to preserve a single occurrence).  

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Translation
- **Unified meaning**:  
  > **"\( a \) must be true in exactly one state.** Specifically:  
    - Before this state, \( a \) is **always false**.  
    - At this state, \( a \) is true.  
    - From the **immediately next state onward**, \( a \) is **forever false**."  

- **Why this works**:  
  - The formula forces a **single "peak" for \( a \)**: false indefinitely, then one true moment, then false forever.  
  - All three parts are enforced:  
    - \( \text{F } a \) ensures the true state exists.  
    - \( \text{G}(a \rightarrow \text{X } \text{G } \neg a) \) ensures **no additional trues** after the first occurrence.  
    - The implication implicitly blocks **prior trues** (preventing contradictions).

#### Final Translation
The formula \( \text{F } a \land \text{G}(a \rightarrow \text{X } \text{G } \neg a) \) means:  
> **"\( a \) must be true in exactly one state: the first occurrence of \( a \) in the execution. All states before this must have \( a \) false, and all states after (starting immediately) must have \( a \) false forever."**
