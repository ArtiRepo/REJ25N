### Translation of the LTL Formula: \( (a \mathop{\mathcal{U}} b) \land \mathcal{G}(a) \)

#### Step 1: Original Formula  
The formula is:  
\( (a \mathop{\mathcal{U}} b) \land \mathcal{G}(a) \)

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
The formula breaks down as follows:  
- **Top-level operator**: Conjunction (\(\land\)), combining two subformulas:  
  - **Left subformula**: \( a \mathop{\mathcal{U}} b \) ("a until b")  
  - **Right subformula**: \( \mathcal{G}(a) \) ("globally a")  

Each subformula is further analyzed:  
- **Until operator (\( \mathop{\mathcal{U}} \))** has two children:  
  - \( a \) (must hold in the initial phase).  
  - \( b \) (eventually terminates the phase).  
- **Globally operator (\( \mathcal{G} \))** has one child:  
  - \( a \) (constraints over all states).

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up  
1. **Interpret \( \mathcal{G}(a) \)**  
   - "\( a \) must be true in **every state** of the system's execution."  
   - This forces \( a \) to hold forever, starting from the current state and extending infinitely into the future.  

2. **Interpret \( a \mathop{\mathcal{U}} b \)**  
   - "\( b \) must eventually occur in some future state, and until the *first* occurrence of \( b \), \( a \) must hold **continuously**."  
   - After \( b \) becomes true, \( a \) has no further obligation (*unless* constrained by other parts of the formula).  

3. **Combine with Conjunction (\( \land \))**  
   Both subformulas must hold **simultaneously**:  
   - \( \mathcal{G}(a) \) demands \( a \) **always** holds.  
   - \( a \mathop{\mathcal{U}} b \) demands:  
     - \( b \) **eventually occurs**, and  
     - \( a \) holds **until** \( b \) occurs.  

   However, \( \mathcal{G}(a) \) implies \( a \) holds *even after* \( b \) occurs. Thus:  
   - The \( a \mathop{\mathcal{U}} b \) condition is **automatically strengthened** by \( \mathcal{G}(a) \):  
     - Its "until" constraint (\( a \) holding until \( b \)) is satisfied because \( a \) *always* holds (per \( \mathcal{G}(a) \)), but...  
     - Its termination condition (\( b \) occurring) **remains critical**.  
   - **Result**: The combined formula reduces to two independent but compatible requirements:  
     - **Eternal \( a \)**: \( a \) must hold in every state.  
     - **Occurrence of \( b \)**: \( b \) must become true in at least one state (finite time).  

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Translation  
> "**\( a \) must be true in every state, from now and forever. Additionally, \( b \) must eventually become true at least once (either now or in a future state).**"  

#### Why This Works  
- **Satisfaction condition**:  
  - Any execution where \( a \) is permanently true, and \( b \) occurs at least once (e.g., states: \([a,\ b]\), \([a,\ a,\ b,\ a, ...]\)).  
- **Unsatisfaction examples**:  
  - \( a \) fails in any state → violates \( \mathcal{G}(a) \).  
  - \( a \) always holds, but \( b \) **never** occurs → violates \( a \mathop{\mathcal{U}} b \).  

This phrasing merges the components logically: \( \mathcal{G}(a) \) dominates the timeline, while \( a \mathop{\mathcal{U}} b \) adds the **necessity of \( b\)'s occurrence**.
