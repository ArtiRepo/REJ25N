### Translation of LTL Formula: `X !b & d`

#### Step 1: Original Formula  
`X !b & d`  

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
The formula is a **conjunction** (`&`) of two subformulas:  
- **Left branch**: `X !b`  
  - `X` (Next operator) applied to `!b`.  
  - `!b` (Negation) applied to atomic proposition `b`.  
- **Right branch**: `d` (atomic proposition).  

Parsing tree:  
```
      &
     / \
    X   d
    |
    !
    |
    b
```

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning from Bottom Up  
1. **Atomic propositions**:  
   - `d`: Must hold in the **current state**.  
   - `b`: Must hold in a state (but here it's negated).  
2. **Negation (`!b`)**:  
   - `b` is **false** in the given state.  
3. **Next (`X !b`)**:  
   - `!b` must hold in the **immediately next state**.  
   → *"b must be false in the next state."*  
4. **Conjunction (`X !b & d`)**:  
   - **Both subformulas must hold**:  
     - `d` is true **now** (current state).  
     - `b` is false in the **next state**.  

#### Step 4: Natural Language Translation  
> **"`d` is true in the current state, and `b` is false in the immediately following state."**  

#### Key Explanations:  
- **Current constraint**: `d` must hold **at the start** of the execution.  
- **Future constraint**: `b` must be **false in the very next state**.  
- **No constraints beyond**:  
  - The formula does **not** constrain states beyond the next one.  
  - `b` and `d` can be arbitrary **except** for:  
    - State *t<sub>0</sub>*: `d = true`.  
    - State *t<sub>1</sub>*: `b = false`.  

##### Visual Timeline:  
| Time | *t<sub>0</sub>* (current) | *t<sub>1</sub>* (next) | *t<sub>2</sub>*, *t<sub>3</sub>*, ... |  
|------|---------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
| `d`  | **true**                  | *(any)*               | *(any)*                              |  
| `b`  | *(any)*                   | **false**             | *(any)*                              |  

This formula focuses **exclusively** on the current and next state, leaving all other states/future behavior unconstrained.
