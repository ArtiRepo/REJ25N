### Original LTL Formula
`G t | F w`

**Note:** `|` represents logical OR (`∨`). The formula is `G(t) ∨ F(w)`.

---

### Step 1: Parsing Tree Breakdown
The formula has two top-level subformulas combined with **OR** (`∨`):
1. **Left operand:** `G t` (Globally `t`)
2. **Right operand:** `F w` (Finally `w`)

**Parsing Tree:**
```
     ∨
    / \
   /   \
 G(t)  F(w)
```

### Step 2: Rebuild Meaning from the Bottom Up

#### **Subformula 1: `G t`**
- **Operator:** `G` (Globally)
- **Meaning:** `t` must be true in **every state** of the execution.  
  *Violation condition:* If `t` is false in **any state** (even one), `G(t)` fails.

#### **Subformula 2: `F w`**
- **Operator:** `F` (Finally)
- **Meaning:** `w` must be true in **at least one future state** (including the current state).  
  *Violation condition:* If `w` is **never true** in the entire execution, `F(w)` fails.

#### **Combined with OR (`∨`)**
- The formula `G(t) ∨ F(w)` is satisfied if **at least one** subformula is true:  
  - Either `t` holds **globally** (`G(t)` is true), **OR**  
  - `w` holds **at least once** (`F(w)` is true),  
  - Or **both** conditions hold.  
  *Violation condition:* Only violated if **both** subformulas are false:  
  - `t` fails in **at least one state** (so `G(t)` is false), **AND**  
  - `w` is **never true** (so `F(w)` is false).

### Step 3: Refined Natural Language Translation
> **Translation:**  
> "The system must ensure that **either `t` is always true, or `w` eventually occurs (or both)."  

#### Explanation of Constraints:
- **When is it satisfied?**  
  - If `t` holds **in every state** (no restrictions on `w`).  
    *Example:* Trajectory `[t, t, t, ...]` → **valid**.  
  - If `w` becomes true **at least once**, even if `t` fails somewhere.  
    *Example:* Trajectory `[¬t, t, w, ...]` → **valid** (regardless of `t` later).  
  - If **both** conditions hold.  
    *Example:* Trajectory `[t, w, t, ...]` → **valid**.

- **When is it violated?**  
  Only if **both** constraints fail:  
  - `t` is false in **at least one state**, **AND**  
  - `w` is **never true** in the entire execution.  
  *Example:* Trajectory `[t, ¬t, ¬w, ¬w, ...]` → **violated** (`t` fails at state 2, `w` never occurs).

### Key Insight
- This formula **does not mandate `t` to hold forever** if `w` eventually occurs.  
- It **relaxes the requirement** for `t`: As long as `w` appears *sometime*, `t` may fail intermittently.  
- Only if `w` **never occurs** does the system **strictly require `t` to hold globally**.  

This balances constraints: safety (`G t`) and eventual recovery/completion (`F w`).
