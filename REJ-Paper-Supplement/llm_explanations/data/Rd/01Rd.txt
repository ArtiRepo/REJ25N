### Translation of LTL Formula: \(X(a) \implies X(c)\)

**Original Formula:**  
\(X(a) \implies X(c)\)

**Step 1: Formula Breakdown (Parsing Tree)**  
This formula is an **implication** (\(\implies\)) with two sub-formulas:  
- Left operand: \(X(a)\) ("a must be true in the very next state").  
- Right operand: \(X(c)\) ("c must be true in the very next state").  

The structure is:  
```
      IMPLIES
      /      \
     X(a)    X(c)
```

**Step 2: Bottom-Up Meaning Reconstruction**  
- **Base meanings:**  
  - \(X(a)\): Requires `a` to hold in the immediate next state.  
  - \(X(c)\): Requires `c` to hold in the immediate next state.  
- **Implication (\(\implies\)):**  
  \(P \implies Q\) means:  
  > *"Whenever \(P\) is true, \(Q\) must also be true."*  
    
  Here, \(P = X(a)\) and \(Q = X(c)\), so:  
  > *"If \(X(a)\) holds (a is true in the next state), then \(X(c)\) must hold (c must *also* be true in that same next state)."*  

**Step 3: Refined Natural Language Translation**  
- **Core meaning:**  
  > **"If `a` is true in the next state, then `c` must be true in that same next state."**  

- **Implicit constraints:**  
  - This **only constrains the immediate next state**, not the current state or future states beyond the next one.  
  - If `a` is false in the next state, the formula is **automatically satisfied** (no requirement for `c`).  
  - If `a` is true in the next state, `c` **must be true there too** (avoiding the case where `a` is true and `c` is false at that step).  

**Violation Condition:**  
The formula is violated **only if**, in the next state:  
- \(a\) is true, but \(c\) is false.  

**Example:**  
- Valid execution: Next state has `a = false`, `c = true` → satisfied.  
- Valid execution: Next state has `a = true`, `c = true` → satisfied.  
- **Invalid execution:** Next state has `a = true`, `c = false` → violated.  

**Final Natural Language Phrasing:**  
> **"If `a` holds in the next state, then `c` must also hold in that same state."**  

This emphasizes the critical constraint in the immediate future while clarifying that no other states are affected.
