To translate the LTL formula **`a U b`** (a **U**ntil b) into natural language, follow this structured reasoning process:

### Step 1: Original LTL Formula
- Formula: `a U b`

### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown
- **Operator**: `U` (Until)  
- **Operands**: 
  - Left child: Atomic proposition `a`  
  - Right child: Atomic proposition `b`  
- **Tree Structure**:
  ```
     U
    / \
   a   b
  ```

### Step 3: Rebuild Meaning from the Bottom Up
1. **Atomic Propositions** `a` and `b`:
   - `a`: Must be true in a specific state (e.g., "switch is on").
   - `b`: Must be true in a specific state (e.g., "alarm triggers").

2. **Until Operator (`U`)**:
   - Constraints for `a U b`:
     - **Requirement 1**: `b` must become true *at least once* in some future state.  
     - **Requirement 2**: From the **current state** onward, `a` must hold *continuously* **until the exact moment** `b` becomes true.  
   - Once `b` becomes true:
     - The obligation for `a` to hold *ceases* at and after the state where `b` is true.  
     - Future states after `b` becomes true have no constraints (unless defined by other formulas).

### Step 4: Refine Natural Language Phrasing
**Simple Translation**:  
> *"`b` must eventually become true, and `a` must hold continuously until that moment."*

#### Further Clarification
- **Why "until the moment" and not "including the moment"?**  
  The requirement for `a` to hold ends **as soon as `b` becomes true**.  
  - Example:  
    - States: `[a=true, a=true, b=true, ...]` → **Valid** (at `b`'s state, `a` "hands off" to `b`).  
    - States: `[a=true, a=false, b=true, ...]` → **Invalid** (`a` broke *before* `b` became true).  

- **What if `b` is true now?**  
  The formula is **immediately satisfied** (no prior requirement for `a` applies).  

- **What if `b` never holds?**  
  The formula is **never satisfied**, even if `a` holds forever.  

### Final Translation
> "**`b` must eventually become true, and `a` must hold continuously until the exact state where `b` becomes true.**"  

This phrasing emphasizes  
- The **inevitability** of `b`,  
- The **unbroken requirement** for `a` *until* `b`’s occurrence,  
- And freedom for `a` to vary once `b` is true.
