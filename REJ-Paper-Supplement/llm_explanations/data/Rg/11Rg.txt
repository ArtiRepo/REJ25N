**Original LTL Formula:**  
`a U (b & c)`

**Step-by-Step Reasoning (Bottom-Up):**  
1. **Innermost component: `b & c`**  
   - Represents **simultaneous truth**: Both `b` and `c` must hold *in the same state*.  

2. **Until operator: `a U (b & c)`**  
   - There are two requirements:  
     - **Eventuality**: A state where `b` and `c` are *both* true must occur.  
     - **Invariance until then**: `a` must hold *continuously* from **now** until *immediately before* that state.  

**Natural Language Translation:**  
"The system must eventually reach a state (which may be now or in the future) where both `b` and `c` are true simultaneously. From the current state until the moment *just before* that state occurs, `a` must hold in every state. After `b` and `c` become true together, `a` is no longer constrained."

**Key Clarifications:**  
- **Immediate satisfaction**:  
  - If both `b` and `c` are true **now**, the formula is satisfied immediately (no need for `a` to hold now or later).  
- **Delayed satisfaction**:  
  - If `b` and `c` are not yet true, `a` **must hold now** and persist in every state until the future moment when `b` and `c` become true together.  
- **Constraints over time**:  
  - The constraint on `a` applies **only from the current state until the state *before*** `b` and `c` are true. Once `b & c` occurs, all constraints lift.  
- **Violations occur if**:  
  - `b` and `c` **never** occur together, **or**  
  - `a` is **false** in any state *before* the joint `b & c` state.  

**Example Sequences:**  
- ✅ Satisfies: `[a] → [a] → [b, c]`  
  - `a` holds until `b` and `c` co-occur.  
- ✅ Satisfies (immediate): `[b, c] → ...` (any follow-up).  
- ❌ Fails: `[a] → [a] → [a] → ...` (no `b & c` ever).  
- ❌ Fails: `[a] → [¬a] → ... → [b, c]` (`a` fails *before* `b & c`).
