**Original LTL formula:**  
X a => X c  

**Step-by-step reasoning:**  
1. **Innermost components:**  
   - `X a`: "In the very next state, `a` must be true."  
   - `X c`: "In the very next state, `c` must be true."  

2. **Implication (`=>`):**  
   - The formula `X a => X c` means:  
     If `X a` holds (i.e., `a` is true in the next state),  
     then `X c` must hold (i.e., `c` must also be true in that same next state).  
   - Logical equivalence: `!(X a) || X c`, which simplifies to:  
     "Either `a` is false in the next state, **or** `c` is true in the next state."  

3. **Equivalent temporal form:**  
   - `X a => X c` = `X(a -> c)` ⇒ **"In the very next state, if `a` is true, then `c` must be true."**  

**Refined natural language translation:**  
"In the state immediately after the current one, if `a` holds, then `c` must also hold."  

**Explanation of constraints and evolution:**  
1. **Immediate constraints:**  
   - **Current state (now):** No constraints. `a` and `c` can be true or false.  
   - **Next state (immediate future):**  
     - If `a` is true → `c` **must** be true.  
     - If `a` is false → `c` can be true or false (no constraint).  
     - *(The formula imposes direct constraints* only *on this next state.)*  

2. **Beyond the next state:**  
   - No constraints. States beyond the immediate next are irrelevant.  
   - Once the next state is observed, the formula is satisfied or violated for the current evaluation.  

**Satisfaction vs. Violation:**  
- **Satisfied** if in the next state:  
  - `a=false` (regardless of `c`), **or**  
  - `a=true` and `c=true`.  
  - Example sequences:  
    - `(a=false, c=false)`, `(a=false, c=true)`, `(a=true, c=true)` in the next state.  
- **Violated** if in the next state:  
  - `a=true` and `c=false`.  
  - Example: Next state has `a=true` but `c=false`.  

**Key clarifications:**  
- **No ongoing requirements:**  
  - The formula *only* constrains the **immediate next state**. Constraints do not propagate to future states.  
  - After the next state, the formula has no effect (even if re-evaluated later).  
- **No retroactive constraints:**  
  - Past states and the current state are ignored.  
- **Common misunderstanding:**  
  - This is **not** a persistent property (e.g., not "whenever `a` is true, `c` must follow"). It constrains **only** the *very next* state.
