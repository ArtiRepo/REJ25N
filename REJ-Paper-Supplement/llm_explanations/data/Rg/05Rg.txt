**Original LTL Formula:**  
X a & b  

**Translation:**  
"The system must satisfy *b* in the current state and *a* in the immediate next state."  

**Explanation:**  
1. **b**: Must be true **in the current state**. No constraint on *b* in other states.  
2. **X a**: Must be true **in the next state** (directly following the current state). *a* has no constraint in the current state or beyond the next state.  
3. **& (AND)**: Both conditions are required simultaneously.  

**Constraints Timeline:**  
- **Current state (t=0)**: *b* must hold.  
- **Next state (t=1)**: *a* must hold.  
- **After t=1**: No constraints from this formula.  

**Satisfied When:**  
- At t=0: *b* = true, and at t=1: *a* = true.  
  *Example: [b=true] → [a=true, ...]*  

**Violated When:**  
- **Case 1**: *b* = false at t=0.  
  *Example: [b=false] → [...]*  
- **Case 2**: *b* = true at t=0, but *a* = false at t=1.  
  *Example: [b=true] → [a=false, ...]*  

**Key Notes:**  
- If the formula is checked at t=0, its truth is determined by *b* at t=0 and *a* at t=1.  
- Once verified (or violated) at t=0, the formula imposes no future constraints.  
- **No constraints exist** on *a* at t=0 or *b* beyond t=0.
