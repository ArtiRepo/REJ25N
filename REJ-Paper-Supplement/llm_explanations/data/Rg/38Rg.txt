**Original LTL Formula**:  
`(a U b) & (c U d)`  

**Step-by-Step Rebuilding**:  
1. **Subformula `a U b`**:  
   - `b` must eventually be true at some state (now or future).  
   - Until the state where `b` first becomes true, `a` must be true in **every state**.  
   - Once `b` is true, `a` is no longer constrained.  

2. **Subformula `c U d`**:  
   - `d` must eventually be true at some state (now or future).  
   - Until the state where `d` first becomes true, `c` must be true in **every state**.  
   - Once `d` is true, `c` is no longer constrained.  

3. **Combining with `&`**:  
   - Both `(a U b)` and `(c U d)` must hold simultaneously.  
   - The timing of when `b` and `d` become true are **independent**; they may occur at the same state or different states.  

**Refined Natural Language Translation**:  
> "Eventually `b` must become true, and `a` must hold continuously until the exact moment `b` becomes true. Simultaneously, eventually `d` must become true, and `c` must hold continuously until the exact moment `d` becomes true."  

### Key Clarifications:  
- **When constraints apply**:  
  - `a` is required **only until the first occurrence** of `b`; after `b` is true, `a` has no constraints.  
  - `c` is required **only until the first occurrence** of `d`; after `d` is true, `c` has no constraints.  
  - One until-condition may resolve before or after the other (e.g., `b` could occur before `d`, or vice versa).  

- **Immediate vs. Ongoing constraints**:  
  - **If `b` is true now**: `(a U b)` is instantly satisfied (no requirement for `a` in the current state).  
  - **If `d` is true now**: `(c U d)` is instantly satisfied (no requirement for `c` in the current state).  
  - **If neither is true now**:  
    - `a` must be true now, and remain true until `b` occurs.  
    - `c` must be true now, and remain true until `d` occurs.  

- **Violating Scenarios**:  
  􏰀- `b`** never occurs**: `(a U b)` fails (regardless of `a`).  
  􏰀- `d`** never occurs**: `(c U d)` fails (regardless of `c`).  
  - `a` **fails once before `b`**: `(a U b)` fails (even if `b` later occurs).  
  - `c` **fails once before `d`**: `(c U d)` fails (even if `d` later occurs).  

- **Common Misunderstandings**:  
  - `a`/`c` are **not required after `b`/`d` occur** (despite being "until").  
  - `b` and `d` **need not occur together** (they may resolve at different times).
