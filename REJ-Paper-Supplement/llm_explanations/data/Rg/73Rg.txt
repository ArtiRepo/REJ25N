**Original LTL formula:**  
F a  

**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**  
1. **Atomic proposition `a`**:  
   - Represents a state predicate. At any given state, `a` must be true for that state to satisfy `a`.  

2. **Operator `F` (Finally)**:  
   - `F(a)` requires that `a` holds in **at least one state** in the future (including the current state).  

**Natural language translation:**  
"Eventually, `a` becomes true at least once."  

**Refined explanation:**  
- **Satisfaction condition:**  
  The formula is satisfied if `a` is true in the current state or any future state. Once `a` becomes true (e.g., at time *t*), the formula is permanently satisfied, regardless of subsequent states.  
- **Violation condition:**  
  The formula is violated only if `a` remains **false in all states** from the current state onward.  
- **Constraints over time:**  
  - **Applies:** The constraint that "`a` must eventually hold" is active until the first occurrence where `a` is true.  
  - **Ceases:** After `a` becomes true once, the constraint is lifted. Future values of `a` (true or false) no longer affect the formula's truth.  
- **Key clarification:**  
  `F a` does **not** require `a` to be true continuously or beyond its first occurrence. It only demands a single occurrence (now or later).  

**Example sequences:**  
- Satisfying: `[a=false, a=false, a=true, ...]` → Holds at step 3.  
- Violating: `[a=false, a=false, a=false, ...]` (forever false).
