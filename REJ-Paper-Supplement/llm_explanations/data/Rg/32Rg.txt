**Original LTL Formula:**  
`(b | !a) & X (d U c)`  

**Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up:**  
1. `!a`: "In the current state, `a` is false."  
2. `b | !a`: "In the current state, either `b` is true or `a` is false (or both)."  
   - *Content hint:* Violated only if `a` is true AND `b` is false in the current state.  
3. `d U c`: 
   - "There exists a future state (starting from the state where this subformula is evaluated) where `c` is true."  
   - "In every state from the initial evaluation state up to (but not including) the state where `c` first becomes true, `d` must be true."  
   - *Content hint:* No constraint on `d` at or after the state where `c` becomes true. If `c` is immediately true, no `d` constraints apply.  
4. `X (d U c)`:  
   - "In the **very next state**, `d U c` holds."  
   - "The constraint `d U c` applies starting from the next state onward."  
5. `(b | !a) & X (d U c)`:  
   - Combined: "In the current state, either `b` holds or `a` is false (or both), AND the requirements for `d U c` must hold beginning in the **next** state."  

**Refined Natural Language Translation:**  
> "In the current state, either `b` is true or `a` is false (or both). Starting from the very next state, **two ongoing constraints** apply:  
> - **Eventually, `c` must become true** (at least once in the future, beginning from the next state).  
> - From the next state onward, **`d` must hold continuously** until the state **immediately before** `c` first becomes true.  
>  
> **Key clarifications:**  
> - If `c` is already true in the next state, `d` need not hold anywhere (including the next state).  
> - Once `c` becomes true (any time after the current state), `d` is no longer required to hold in subsequent states.  
> - The constraints on `a` and `b` apply **only to the current state**; they do not restrict future states.  
>  
> **Violations occur if:**  
> - The current state has `a` true AND `b` false, **or**  
> - After the current state, `c` never becomes true, **or**  
> - `d` is false in any state **between the next state and the state just before `c` first becomes true**."
