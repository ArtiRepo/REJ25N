**Original LTL Formula:**  
(a U b) and G(a)  

**Step-by-Step Translation:**  
1. **Subformula `G(a)`**:  
   "`a` must be true in **every state** of the execution (now and forever)."  

2. **Subformula `(a U b)`**:  
   "`b` must eventually become true at least once. Until the **first occurrence** of `b`, `a` must be true in every preceding state. After `b` becomes true, `a` has no further requirement from this subformula."  

3. **Combining with `and`**:  
   Both subformulas must hold simultaneously:  
   - `G(a)` forces `a` to be true **in all states indefinitely**.  
   - `(a U b)` forces `b` to occur at least once, with `a` holding strictly **until the first `b`**.  
   However, `G(a)`’s requirement that `a` holds **forever** supersedes the limited duration of `a` in `(a U b)`. Thus:  
   - `a` must be true **in every state** (from `G(a)`).  
   - `b` must become true **at least once** (from `(a U b)`).  

**Refined Natural Language Phrasing:**  
> "`a` must be true in **every state** (now and forever), and `b` must eventually become true **at least once**."  

**Key Constraints Explained:**  
- **`a`**:  
  - **Constraint applies**: Immediately and in **every state** thereafter.  
  - **Ceases**: Never; violation if `a` is false in any state.  
- **`b`**:  
  - **Constraint applies**: Until the **first occurrence** of `b` (which must happen eventually).  
  - **Ceases**: After `b` becomes true once; no further constraints on `b` (it can be true/false arbitrarily afterward).  

**Satisfying vs. Violating Sequences:**  
- ✅ **Satisfying example**:  
  `[a, a, b, a, a, ...]` (all states have `a`; `b` becomes true at least once).  
- ❌ **Violating examples**:  
  - `[a, a, ¬a, ...]`: `a` becomes false (violates `G(a)`).  
  - `[a, a, a, ...]` (no `b` ever): `b` never occurs (violates `(a U b)`).  
  - `[¬a, ...]`: `a` false initially (violates both subformulas).  

**Clarification of Misunderstandings:**  
- The `until` (`U`) requires `a` only until the **first** `b`, but `G(a)` forces `a` to hold **even after `b` occurs**.  
- The formula is **violated permanently** if `a` ever fails, or if `b` never occurs.  
- Once `b` occurs, the `until` subformula is satisfied forever, but `G(a)` continues to constrain all future states.  

**Final Translation:**  
> "`a` must hold in every state forever, and `b` must eventually become true at least once."
