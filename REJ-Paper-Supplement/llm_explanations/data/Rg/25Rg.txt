### Translation of the LTL Formula: `!X t`

1. **Original LTL Formula**:  
   `!X t`

2. **Rebuild Meaning from the Bottom Up**:  
   - **`t`**: The atomic proposition `t` is true in the **current state**. No constraints on other states.  
   - **`X t`**: "The proposition `t` must be true in the **very next state**." This imposes a constraint exclusively on the immediate successor of the current state.  
   - **`!X t`**: The negation of `X t`. Thus, "The proposition `t` must be **false in the very next state**."  

3. **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**:  
   "**The next state must have `t` false.**"

### Explanation of Semantics:  
- **When the formula is checked**:  
  The constraint applies **only to the immediate next state** in the sequence. The current state's value of `t` is irrelevant (i.e., `t` can be true or false now).  

- **Constraints over time**:  
  - **Satisfaction condition**: The formula holds if the state immediately following the current one has `t = false`.  
  - **Violation condition**: The formula fails if `t` is true in the next state.  
  - **No ongoing constraints**: After the next state, the formula imposes **no further restrictions** on `t` (in states beyond the next, `t` can be true or false without affecting this formula's truth).  

- **Examples**:  
  - **Satisfying trace**: `[t=false] → [t=false] → ...` (since next state has `t=false`).  
  - **Violating trace**: `[t=true] → [t=true] → ...` (next state has `t=true`).  
  - **Misconception to avoid**: This formula **does not require** `t` to be false in the current state or in all future states—only **strictly in the next state**.  

- **Evolution of truth**:  
  The formula can only be evaluated at a single point in time (the current state). Once the system moves to the next state, a new evaluation of `!X t` would apply to *that* state's next state.
