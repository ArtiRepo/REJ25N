**Original LTL formula:**  
`b | !X a`

**Rebuilt Meaning Bottom-Up:**

1. **`a`**: Proposition `a` represents a condition that may be true or false in a given state.  
   → Constraints: None until evaluated at a specific state.

2. **`X a`**: "`a` must be true in the **next state** (immediately after the current state)."  
   → Constraints: Only applies to the state immediately following the current evaluation point.  
   → Violation: If `a` is false in that next state.

3. **`!X a`**: Negation of `X a`.  
   → "`a` must be **false in the next state**."  
   → Constraints: Only restricts the next state; other states are unaffected.  
   → Violation: If `a` is true in the next state.

4. **`b`**: Proposition `b` represents a condition.  
   → Constraints: Only applies to the **current state** (where the formula is evaluated).

5. **`b | !X a`**: Disjunction (logical OR) of `b` (current state) and `!X a` (next state).  
   - **Satisfaction**: The formula holds at the current state if **at least one** of these is true:  
     - `b` is true **now** (in the current state), *or*  
     - `a` is false **in the next state**.  
   - **Constraints**:  
     - If `b` is true now, `a` **has no constraints** in the next state.  
     - If `b` is false now, `a` **must be false** in the next state.  
   → The formula only restricts **up to the next state**. Beyond that, no constraints apply.

**Natural Language Translation:**  
"Either `b` holds now, **or** `a` is false in the next state. Specifically, if `b` is false in the current state, `a` must be false in the immediate next state."  

**Key Clarifications:**  
- **When constraints apply**:  
  - **Current state**: `b` is only constrained at the evaluation point.  
  - **Next state**: `a` is constrained only if `b` is false now.  
- **Termination of constraints**: After the next state, the formula imposes no further restrictions.  
- **Critical edge case**: If `b` is false now and `a` is true next, the formula is **violated**.  
- **Fulfillment**:   
  - If `b` is true now, the next state is unconstrained regardless of `a`.  
  - If `b` is false now and `a` is false next, the formula holds.  

**Example Violating Sequence**:  
`[b=false, a=true]` → Fails because `b` is false now, but `a` is true next.  

**Example Satisfying Sequences**:  
- `b=true` now → Formula holds (no constraint on next `a`).  
- `b=false` now & `a=false` next → Formula holds.
