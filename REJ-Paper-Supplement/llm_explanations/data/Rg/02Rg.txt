### Original LTL Formula:
**X b ⇒ ¬X d**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Subformula Breakdown**:
   - **X b**: "b must be true in the very next state."
   - **X d**: "d must be true in the very next state."
   - **¬X d**: "d must be **false** in the very next state" (negation of `X d`).
   - **Implication (X b ⇒ ¬X d)**: This is equivalent to "**if** `X b` holds (b is true in the next state), **then** `¬X d` must hold (d is false in the next state)."

2. **Truth Conditions**:
   - The formula is **satisfied** at the current state if:
     - The next state has **b = false** (antecedent `X b` is false, so the implication holds regardless of `d`).
     - **Or**, the next state has **b = true and d = false** (consequent `¬X d` ensures `d` is false).
   - The formula is **violated** at the current state **only** if the next state has **b = true and d = true**.

3. **Constraints and Applicability**:
   - **Immediate constraint**: Applies **only** to the **next state**.
   - **When constrained**: 
     - If `b` is true in the next state, `d` **must be false** in that same state.
     - If `b` is false in the next state, `d` **has no constraint** (it may be true or false).
   - **Lifespan**: The formula is fully evaluated at the **current state** based on the **next state**. After the next state occurs, the formula ceases to impose any constraints.

4. **Example Sequences** (current state = t₀, next state = t₁):
   - **Satisfying sequence**: 
     - t₁: `b=false`, `d=true` → Formula holds (no dependence on `d` when `b=false`).
     - t₁: `b=true`, `d=false` → Formula holds (`b=true` forces `d=false`).
     - t₁: `b=false`, `d=false` → Formula holds.
   - **Violating sequence**: 
     - t₁: `b=true`, `d=true` → Formula fails (forbids `b ∧ d` in the next state).

### Refined Natural Language Phrasing:
**"If b is true in the next state, then d must be false in that same next state. If b is a false in the next state, d may be either true or false."**  

This captures:
- The **strict conditional constraint** (when `b` holds, `d` is forbidden).
- The **absence of constraint** when `b` is false.
- The **exclusive focus on the immediate next state**.
