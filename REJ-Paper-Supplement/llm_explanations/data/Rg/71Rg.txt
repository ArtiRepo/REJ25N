**Original LTL formula:**  
G(a and !b)  

**Step-by-step breakdown:**  
1. **Innermost expression: `a and !b`**  
   - Meaning: "In the current state, `a` is true AND `b` is false."  
   - Constraints: Applies **only to the current state** when evaluated.  

2. **Outermost operator: `G` (Global)**  
   - Meaning: "The inner expression `(a and !b)` must hold **in every state** of the execution."  
   - Constraints: Applies to **all states**—past, present, and future—from the moment of evaluation.  

**Refined natural language translation:**  
"Throughout the entire execution, `a` is always true and `b` is always false."  

**Key clarifications:**  
- **When constraints apply:**  
  - The formula imposes constraints **in every state** without exception.  
  - At any state where `a` is false or `b` is true, the formula is **immediately violated**.  
- **Termination of constraints:**  
  - Constraints **never cease**; they persist indefinitely.  
- **Satisfying sequences:**  
  - Only sequences where **every state** has `a = true` and `b = false` satisfy the formula.  
  - Example: `[a:⊤, b:⊥] → [a:⊤, b:⊥] → [a:⊤, b:⊥] → ...`  
- **Violating sequences:**  
  - Any sequence with **at least one state** where `a` is false or `b` is true violates the formula.  
  - Example: `[a:⊤, b:⊥] → [a:⊥, b:⊥] → ...` (fails when `a` becomes false).  
  - Example: `[a:⊤, b:⊥] → [a:⊤, b:⊤] → ...` (fails when `b` becomes true).  
- **Misconception prevention:**  
  - This is **not a conditional requirement** (e.g., no "until" or "eventually" logic).  
  - The system **cannot temporarily relax** the constraints; violations are permanent and irrecoverable.
