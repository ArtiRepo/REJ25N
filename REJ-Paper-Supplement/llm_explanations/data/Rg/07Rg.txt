**Original LTL Formula:**  
a U c  

**Translation and Explanation:**  
1. **Immediate Satisfaction Condition:**  
   - If `c` is true in the current state, the formula is immediately satisfied. There is **no constraint** on `a` (now or in the future).  

2. **Ongoing Constraints (if `c` is false now):**  
   - `c` **must eventually become true** at some future state.  
   - Until the state where `c` first becomes true, `a` **must be true in every state** (including the current state).  

3. **Constraint Termination:**  
   - Once `c` becomes true (at the first occurrence), the requirement for `a` to hold **ceases permanently**. After this, `a` may be true or false freely.  

4. **Violation Conditions:**  
   - **Scenario 1:** `c` never becomes true (violates eventual requirement).  
   - **Scenario 2:** `c` is false now, and `a` is false in any state before `c` becomes true (breaks continuity of `a`).  

**Final Natural Language Phrasing:**  
*"c must eventually become true. Until that moment, a must hold continuously. If c is already true now, no constraints apply to a."*
