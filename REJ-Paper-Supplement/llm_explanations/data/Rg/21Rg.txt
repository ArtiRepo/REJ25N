**Original LTL formula:**  
X (t & y)  

**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**  
1. **Atomic propositions `t` and `y`**:  
   - `t` must be true in the state where it is evaluated.  
   - `y` must be true in the state where it is evaluated.  
2. **Conjunction `t & y`**:  
   - Both `t` and `y` must be true **simultaneously** in the same state.  
3. **Next operator `X(...)`**:  
   - The constraint `t & y` must hold **in the immediate next state** (i.e., the state directly following the current one).  

**Refined natural language translation:**  
"In the next state, both `t` and `y` must be true."  

**Key implications:**  
- **Constraint application**:  
  - The formula **only constrains the immediate next state**.  
  - The current state and all states beyond the next one are **unaffected** (no requirements on `t` or `y` there).  
- **Satisfaction/violation**:  
  - **Satisfied** if:  
    - In the next state, `t` is true **and** `y` is true.  
    - *Example sequence*: `[t=false, y=false] → [t=true, y=true] → [...]` (holds regardless of later states).  
  - **Violated** if:  
    - In the next state, `t` is false **or** `y` is false (or both).  
    - *Example sequence*: `[t=true, y=true] → [t=false, y=true] → [...]` (fails at the next state).  
- **Evolution over time**:  
  - The formula is **evaluated at the current state** but **constrains only the next state**.  
  - Once the next state is observed, the formula’s constraint **ceases to apply** (no further impact on future states).  
- **Misunderstanding prevention**:  
  - This formula **does not require** `t` or `y` to be true in the current state.  
  - It **does not guarantee** anything beyond the immediate next state.
