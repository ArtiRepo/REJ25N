**Original LTL Formula:**  
`(c U a) & (b U a)`  

**Translation and Explanation:**  
"The formula requires that `a` eventually becomes true. Until the moment `a` becomes true, **both `b` and `c` must hold continuously in every state**. Once `a` becomes true, there are no further constraints on `b` or `c`."  

### Key Details:  
- **Satisfaction Condition:**  
  - If `a` is true **now**, the formula is immediately satisfied (no requirements for `b` or `c` in any state).  
  - If `a` is false now, **both `b` and `c` must be true now and in every subsequent state** until `a` becomes true (which must eventually occur).  

- **Violation Condition:**  
  - `a` never becomes true, **or**  
  - Before `a` becomes true, any state has `b` false **or** `c` false.  

- **Evolution of Constraints:**  
  - **Before `a` is true:** `b` and `c` are strictly required in every state.  
  - **After `a` becomes true:** All constraints on `b` and `c` are permanently lifted.  

### Clarification Against Misunderstandings:  
- Both `(c U a)` and `(b U a)` share the **same trigger** (`a`). They do not require separate occurrences of `a`.  
- The constraints on `b` and `c` apply **only until `a` occurs**; they may become arbitrary afterward.  
- If `a` holds initially, `b` and `c` are **never constrained**.  

**Example Sequences:**  
- Satisfying: `[b,c] → [b,c] → [a]` (or `[a]` immediately).  
- Violating: `[b,c] → [b] → ...` (missing `c` before `a`), or `[b,c] → [b,c] → ...` (no `a`).
