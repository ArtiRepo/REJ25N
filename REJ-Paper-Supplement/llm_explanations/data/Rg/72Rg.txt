**Original LTL formula:**  
G ¬a  

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom up:**  
- **¬a**: *a* must be false in the current state.  
- **G(¬a)**: The requirement "*¬a* holds" (i.e., *a* is false) must be true in every state of the execution, including the current state and all future states.  

**Refined natural language phrasing for clarity:**  
*a* must always be false. This means:  
- In the **current state**, *a* must be false.  
- In **every future state**, *a* must remain false.  
- The constraint applies **permanently** to all states and **never ceases**; if *a* becomes true in any state (current or future), the formula is violated.
