**Original LTL formula:**  
Xa U Xb  

**Step-by-step reasoning from the bottom up:**  
1. **Subformula `Xa`**: "In the immediate next state, `a` must be true."  
2. **Subformula `Xb`**: "In the immediate next state, `b` must be true."  
3. **Until operator (`U`)**:  
   - The formula `Xa U Xb` requires:  
     - **Eventuality**: There exists a future state (starting from the current state) where `Xb` holds.  
     - **Persistence**: In every state from the current state until (but not including) the state where `Xb` holds, `Xa` must hold.  
   - Substituting the meanings:  
     - `Xb` holds at a state if `b` is true in its immediate next state.  
     - `Xa` holds at a state if `a` is true in its immediate next state.  

**Refined natural language translation:**  
"`b` must become true at some state in the future (starting from the next state), and `a` must be true in every state from the next state until the state immediately before the one where `b` becomes true."  

**Key clarifications:**  
- **Constraints on `a` and `b`**:  
  - `a` is constrained only from the next state until the state preceding where `b` becomes true.  
  - `b` is constrained only at the specific future state where it becomes true (not before or after).  
- **Immediate vs. ongoing constraints**:  
  - At the current state, no direct constraints on `a` or `b` apply.  
  - The formula imposes constraints on future states: `a` must hold continuously from the next state until the state before `b`'s occurrence, and `b` must eventually hold at a specific future state.  
- **When constraints cease**:  
  - Constraints on `a` cease once `b` becomes true in the next state of a future state (i.e., after the state where `b` holds, `a` is unconstrained).  
  - The entire formula is satisfied once `b` holds at the required future state, regardless of subsequent states.  
- **Satisfying vs. violating sequences**:  
  - **Satisfied if**:  
    - `b` is true at the next state (no `a` required), or  
    - `a` is true at the next state, and `b` is true at the state after that, or  
    - `a` is true for `n` consecutive states starting from the next state, and `b` is true at the `(n+1)`-th state (for any `n ≥ 1`).  
  - **Violated if**:  
    - `b` never becomes true in any future state, or  
    - `b` becomes true at some state, but `a` is false in any state from the next state until the state before `b`'s occurrence.  
- **Common misunderstanding**:  
  - `a` is **not required** at the state where `b` becomes true, only in the states leading up to it.  
  - The "next state" is always relative: `Xa` and `Xb` refer to the immediate successor of the state where they are evaluated.
