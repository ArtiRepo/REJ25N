**Original LTL Formula:**  
`d & X (c U a)`  

**Rebuilding Meaning from Bottom Up:**  

1. **`c U a` (Until operator):**  
   - *Meaning:* "`a` must eventually become true at some future state, and in every state from the starting point until (but not including) the state where `a` becomes true, `c` must be true."  
   - *Constraints:*  
     - `c` must hold continuously from the starting state until the state immediately before `a` becomes true.  
     - `a` must become true at least once.  
     - Once `a` becomes true, `c` is no longer constrained beyond that state.  

2. **`X (c U a)` (Next operator applied to `c U a`):**  
   - *Meaning:* "Starting from the **next state** (not the current state), `c U a` must hold."  
   - *Constraints:*  
     - The requirement for `c U a` (eventual `a` and continuous `c` until `a`) begins at the immediate next state.  
     - The current state imposes **no constraints** on `c` or `a`.  

3. **`d & ...` (Conjunction with `d`):**  
   - *Meaning:* "`d` must be true in the **current state**, **and** the condition `X (c U a)` must hold."  
   - *Constraints:*  
     - `d` is required **only in the current state** and imposes no future constraints on `d`.  

**Refined Natural Language Translation:**  
"`d` must hold now. Then, starting from the very next state:  
- `a` must eventually become true at some future state, and  
- `c` must hold continuously in every state from the next state until the state immediately before `a` becomes true.  
Once `a` becomes true, `c` is no longer required."  

**Key Clarifications:**  
- **Current State:** Only `d` must be true. `c` and `a` are unconstrained here.  
- **Next State Onward:**  
  - If `a` is true in the next state, `c` may be true or false (no constraint on `c`).  
  - If `a` is false in the next state, `c` must be true, and this pattern continues until `a` becomes true.  
- **Termination of Constraints:**  
  - `d`’s constraint ends after the current state.  
  - `c`’s constraint ends once `a` becomes true (even if `c` is false in that state).  
- **Violation Conditions:**  
  - `d` is false now, **or**  
  - `a` never becomes true after the next state, **or**  
  - `c` is false in any state between the next state and the state before `a` becomes true.  
- **Satisfaction Example:**  
  - State 0: `d` true.  
  - State 1: `a` true (no constraint on `c`).  
  - *Result:* Formula satisfied immediately after State 0.
