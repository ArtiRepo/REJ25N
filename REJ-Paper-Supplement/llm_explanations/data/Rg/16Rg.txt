### Formula: F !b  
- Breakdown:  
  - **Base**: `!b` → "b must be false in a given state." (No constraint if b is true.)  
  - **Apply F**: `F !b` → "There must exist at least one state (now or later) where `!b` holds."  

### Translation:  
"**b must be false in at least one state (now or in the future).**"  

### Key Constraints Explained:  
1. **When the formula is checked**:  
   - **Satisfied immediately** if b is false in the current state (no future constraints).  
   - **Not satisfied** if b is true in the current state; the system is constrained to **eventually** reach a state where b is false.  

2. **Over time**:  
   - If unmet, the constraint persists **until b becomes false**.  
   - **Once b becomes false** (in any state), the formula is permanently satisfied, and constraints cease.  

3. **Violations**:  
   - The formula is violated **only if b remains true forever**.  

4. **Misunderstandings to avoid**:  
   - Does **not** require b to be true/false in all states.  
   - **No constraints beyond the first false b**—later states are irrelevant.
