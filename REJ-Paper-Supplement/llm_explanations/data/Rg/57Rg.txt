**Original LTL Formula:**  
Fa and G(a → XG¬a)  

**Rebuilding Meaning from Bottom-Up:**  
1. **XG¬a**: "Starting from the very next state, ¬a holds forever (a is false in all subsequent states)."  
2. **a → XG¬a**: "If a is true in the current state, then from the next state onward, a must be false forever."  
3. **G(a → XG¬a)**: "In every state of the execution, if a is true at that state, then a must be false in all states that follow immediately after."  
4. **Fa**: "There exists at least one state (now or in the future) where a is true."  
5. **Fa and G(a → XG¬a)**: Combines (3) and (4):  
   - Fa requires at least one state where a is true.  
   - G(a → XG¬a) ensures that whenever a is true at any state, a must be false forever afterward.  

**Refined Natural Language Translation:**  
"a must be true exactly once: at the first state where it becomes true, and then false forever after."  

**Key Implications:**  
- **Satisfaction Condition**: The formula is satisfied if there exists exactly one state where a is true, and that state is the **first occurrence** of a being true. In all prior states (if any), a is false, and in all subsequent states, a is false.  
- **Constraints Over Time**:  
  - Before the first occurrence of a: No constraint on a (a may be true or false), but if a becomes true earlier than the first occurrence, it violates the "first occurrence" requirement.  
  - At the first occurrence of a: a must be true.  
  - After the first occurrence of a: a must be false in all subsequent states.  
- **Violating Sequences**:  
  - If a is **never true**, Fa is violated.  
  - If a is true in **more than one state**, G(a → XG¬a) is violated (e.g., if a is true at state *i* and later at state *j > i*, the truth at *i* forces a to be false from *i+1* onward, contradicting a being true at *j*).  
  - If a is true **consecutively** (e.g., true at state *i* and *i+1*), XG¬a is violated at state *i* since a is true at *i+1*.  
- **Evolution**:  
  - Once a is true for the first time, the formula imposes a permanent constraint: a must be false forever afterward.  
  - Before the first occurrence, the formula only requires that a eventually becomes true (no ongoing constraints on a’s value until then).  
- **Misunderstandings**:  
  - The "first occurrence" is critical: a cannot be true before this state, and this state must exist.  
  - After the first true state, constraints apply indefinitely; before it, constraints are minimal (only eventual truth).
