**Original LTL Formula:**  
a U G(¬a)  

**Translation and Explanation:**  
The formula **a U G(¬a)** means:  
*"Eventually, a becomes false and remains false forever. Until this permanent switch occurs, **a must be true in every state**."*  

### Key Constraints:  
1. **Permanent falsity of a**:  
   - There exists a specific future state \(k\) (which could be the **current state**) where:  
     - At state \(k\), **a is false**.  
     - *From state \(k\) onward*, **a is false in all subsequent states** (captured by **G(¬a)**).  
   - *Violation example*: If \(a\) becomes false at some point but later turns true again, the requirement fails.  

2. **Temporary truth of a until \(k\)**:  
   - For **every state before \(k\)** (if any exist), **a must be true**.  
   - *Violation example*: If \(a\) is false in any state before \(k\), the formula is unsatisfied.  
   - If \(k = \text{current state}\) (i.e., **G(¬a)** holds now), this constraint is **trivially satisfied** (no prior states).  

### When Constraints Apply and Cease:  
- **Current state**:  
  - If **a is already false and will stay false** forever, the formula is immediately satisfied.  
  - If **a is true now**, the formula imposes:  
    - \(a\) must remain true until the switch to permanent falsity.  
    - Permanent falsity must **occur at a finite time**.  
- **After satisfaction**:  
  - Once the permanent switch to **¬a** occurs (at \(k\)), **no future constraints apply** (all obligations are fulfilled).  

### Notable Cases:  
- **Satisfied if**:  
  - \(a\) is true until it becomes permanently false (e.g., `[a, a, a, ¬a, ¬a, ¬a, ...]`).  
  - \(a\) is false at the first state and remains false forever (e.g., `[¬a, ¬a, ¬a, ...]`).  
- **Violated if**:  
  - \(a\) is **true forever** (permanent falsity never occurs).  
  - \(a\) becomes permanently false but was **false earlier** without holding continuously (e.g., `[a, ¬a, a, ¬a, ¬a, ...]` fails at the second state).  

### Potential Misunderstanding:  
- **"Until the switch"** refers strictly to the **moment when permanent falsity begins**, not a temporary falsity.  
- The formula **forces \(a\) to eventually become false forever** (so infinite \(a\) is impossible).  

\boxed{\text{Eventually } a \text{ becomes and remains false, and until then } a \text{ is true.}}
