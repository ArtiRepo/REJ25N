### Reasoning and Translation for LTL Formula: G(a or b)  
- **Original LTL formula**: `G(a or b)`  

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:  
1. **Innermost subformula (`a or b`)**  
   - Semantic meaning: "Either `a` is true, or `b` is true, or both."  
   - This imposes a **local constraint** only on the current state.  
   - If checked now: Must hold in the current state; otherwise, the formula `a or b` is false.  
   - Does not constrain future states.  

2. **Outermost operator (`G`)**  
   - `G(...)` requires the inner formula `a or b` to hold **globally**: in *all* states of the execution path.  
   - Eliminates time-independence: The inner constraint applies perpetually.  

#### Synthesis:  
- **Complete meaning**: "For every state in the execution, at least one of `a` or `b` must be true."  
- **Key constraints**:  
  - **At every moment** (including the current state and all future states), `a` must be true, `b` must be true, or both.  
  - **Violation**: The formula is **instantly violated** if *any* state has both `a` and `b` false.  
  - **Satisfaction**: Only if no such state exists (e.g., `a` is always true, or `b` is always true, or they alternate).  

#### Refined Natural Language Translation:  
> **"In every moment, either `a` or `b` (or both) must be true."**  

#### Phrasing Rationale:  
- **Brevity and precision**: Explicitly ties "every moment" to the `G` operator and clarifies permitted truth values (`a`/`b`/both).  
- **Avoids ambiguity**: Omits references to specific failures (e.g., "both false") by stating the positive requirement.  
- **Temporal scope**: Constraints apply **continuously**, starting immediately and never relaxing.
