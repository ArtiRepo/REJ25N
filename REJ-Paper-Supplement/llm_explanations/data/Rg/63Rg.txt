**Original LTL formula:**  
XXXa

**Rebuilding meaning bottom-up:**  
1. **Base proposition (a):**  
   "a must hold in the current state" *(relative to its position)*.  
2. **First X-operator (Xa):**  
   "a must hold in the very next state" *(one step after the current state)*.  
3. **Second X-operator (XXa):**  
   "Xa must hold in the next state" → "a must hold in the state two steps ahead".  
4. **Third X-operator (XXXa):**  
   "XXa must hold in the next state" → "a must hold in the state **three steps ahead**".

**Refined natural language translation:**  
"**The proposition a must be true exactly three states from the current state.**"

**Key implications:**  
- **Constraint scope:**  
  - Directly constrains **only** the state at **t+3** (where *t* is the current state).  
  - **No constraints** on the current state (*t*), next state (*t+1*), or the state after that (*t+2*).  
  - After *t+3*, the formula imposes **no further constraints**.  

- **Satisfaction condition:**  
  - Satisfied **at time *t*** if *a* is true at *t+3*.  
  - Violated **at time *t*** if *a* is false at *t+3* (regardless of *a*'s value elsewhere).  

- **Temporal evolution:**  
  - If checked later (e.g., at *t+1*), the formula resets: XXXa at *t+1* would require *a* at *t+4*.  
  - ***Once evaluated at *t*, the formula does not monitor beyond *t+3***.  

**Examples to clarify:**  
- **Satisfying sequence:** `{t: ..., t+1: ..., t+2: ..., t+3: a=true, ...}` → Formula holds at *t*.  
- **Violating sequence:** `{t+3: a=false}` → Formula fails at *t*, even if *a* is true at *t*, *t+1*, *t+2*, or after *t+3*.  

**Common pitfalls to avoid:**  
- Misinterpreting XXXa as "a holds for the next three states" → **Incorrect.**  
  Only the state at **t+3** is constrained; earlier states are unconstrained.  
- Assuming the constraint persists beyond *t+3* → **Incorrect.**  
  The obligation ends once *t+3* is evaluated.
