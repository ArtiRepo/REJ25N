**Original LTL formula:** XXFXa  

**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**  
1. **a**: "a must be true in the current state."  
2. **Xa**: "a must be true in the very next state."  
3. **FXa**: "There must exist at least one future state (including the current) where Xa holds. Since Xa requires truth in the immediate next state, FXa means: *a must be true at least once starting from the next state*."  
4. **X(FXa)**: "In the immediate next state, FXa must hold. This means: *starting from the state after next (i.e., state 2), a must be true at least once*."  
5. **XX(FXa)**: "In the immediate next state, X(FXa) must hold. This means: *at state 2 (two states from now), FXa must hold. Thus, starting from state 3, a must be true at least once*."  

**Refined natural language phrasing:**  
"a must be true at least once, starting from the third state in the future."  

**Key clarifications:**  
- **Constraints on a**:  
  - No constraints on a in states 0 (current), 1 (next), or 2 (two steps ahead).  
  - a must be true in **at least one state from state 3 onward**.  
- **Satisfaction vs. violation**:  
  - **Satisfied if**: a is true at state 3, state 4, state 5, etc. (e.g., `[a=false, a=false, a=false, a=true, ...]`).  
  - **Violated if**: a is **never true from state 3 onward** (e.g., `[a=true, a=true, a=true, a=false, a=false, ...]` fails because a is absent after state 2).  
- **Temporal evolution**:  
  - The formula is evaluated at the current state (state 0).  
  - If a becomes true **only in states 0–2**, the formula is **violated** (constraint applies from state 3 onward).  
  - Once a is true **at or after state 3**, the formula is **permanently satisfied** (no further constraints).  
- **Common misunderstanding**:  
  - The formula does **not forbid a from being true earlier** (states 0–2). Early occurrences are allowed but **do not satisfy** the requirement; a **must** hold at least once at state 3 or later.
