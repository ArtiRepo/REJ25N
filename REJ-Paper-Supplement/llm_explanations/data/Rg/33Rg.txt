**Original LTL Formula:**  
`(b U c) & (d U !b)`  

**Bottom-Up Rebuilding:**  
1. **`b U c`**:  
   - `c` must eventually hold at some state, and `b` must hold continuously until that exact state (but not after).  
   - If `c` holds now, `b` may be true or false now and is unconstrained in the future.  

2. **`d U !b`**:  
   - `!b` (b is false) must eventually hold at some state, and `d` must hold continuously until that exact state (but not after).  
   - If `!b` holds now, `d` may be true or false now and is unconstrained in the future.  

3. **Conjunction (`&`)**:
   - Both subformulas must hold simultaneously, sharing timeline constraints around the occurrence of `c` and `!b`.  

**Refined Natural Language Phrasing:**  
*"Eventually, `b` must become false for the first time at a state T. Until immediately before T, both `b` and `d` must hold continuously. At T or earlier, `c` must have been true at least once. After T, `b`, `c`, and `d` are unconstrained by this formula."*  

### Key Explanations:  
- **First violation of `b` (at T)**:  
  - `!b` must occur for the first time at some finite future state T.  
  - **Before T**: Both `b` and `d` must hold in every state from now until T-1. Failing either violates the formula.  
- **Occurrence of `c`**:  
  - `c` must hold at least once between now and T (inclusive). If `c` does not occur by T, the formula is violated.  
- **After T**:  
  - All constraints on `b`, `c`, and `d` cease. `b` may become true again, `c` may never reoccur, and `d` may be arbitrary.  

### Satisfying vs. Violating Sequences:  
- **Satisfies**:  
  - `[b,d] → [b,d,c] → [!b,...]` (c at T-1, !b at T; d holds until T-1).  
  - `[b,d,c] → [b,d] → [!b,...]` (c at state 0, !b at T>0; b/d remain true until T-1).  
- **Violates**:  
  - `[b,d] → [b,d] → [...]` (b never false → violates `d U !b`).  
  - `[b] → [!b,...]` (d false initially → violates `d U !b`).  
  - `[b,d] → [b,!d] → [...]` (d becomes false and !b hasn’t occurred yet → violates `d U !b`).  
  - `[b,d] → [!b,...]` (b false at T but c never true by T → violates `b U c`).  

**Crucial Nuance**:  
- `c` may occur at or before T, but not after T.  
- The "until" constraints **only apply strictly before T**; values at T (e.g., `d`) are irrelevant.  
- The formula requires `b`’s **first** falsehood to anchor the timeline; subsequent `!b` is ignored.
