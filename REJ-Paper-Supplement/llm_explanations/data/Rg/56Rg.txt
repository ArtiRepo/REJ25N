**Original LTL Formula:**  
(!a) U (a and XG!a)  

**Step-by-Step Rebuilding from Bottom Up:**  
1. **G!a**: "a is false in every state from the point of evaluation onward."  
2. **XG!a**: "Starting from the very next state, a is false forever."  
3. **(a and XG!a)**: "a is true in the current state, and from the next state onward, a is false forever."  
4. **!a**: "a is false in the current state."  
5. **(!a) U (a and XG!a)**:  
   - "a remains false until a state where (a and XG!a) holds."  
   - This requires:  
     - Eventually, at some state j (at or after the current state), (a and XG!a) is true.  
     - For all states from the current state until the state before j, a is false.  

**Refined Natural Language Translation:**  
"The formula requires that a remains false until a specific state j (at or after the current state) where a becomes true, and then from the very next state onward, a remains false forever. This implies a is true exactly once from the current state onward (at j) and false in all other states."  

**Key Implications:**  
- **Constraints on a**:  
  - From the current state until j (exclusive), a must be false.  
  - At state j, a must be true.  
  - From state j+1 onward, a must be false forever.  
- **When constraints apply**:  
  - If satisfied immediately (j = current state): No prior falsehood required (no states before j).  
  - If j is in the future: a must be false continuously until j.  
- **Cessation of constraints**:  
  - After state j, no further constraints on a (it must remain false, but this is already ensured by XG!a).  
- **Violation conditions**:  
  - a is never true at any state j where XG!a holds (e.g., a becomes true but later true again, violating XG!a).  
  - a is true before j (violates the "until" phase).  
- **Potential misunderstanding**:  
  - The "until" does not require a to be true *before* j—it forbids a being true until j.  
  - The single occurrence of a (at j) is enforced by the combined requirements of the until and the post-j perpetual falsehood.
