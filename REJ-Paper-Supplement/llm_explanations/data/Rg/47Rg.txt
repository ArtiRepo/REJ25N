**Original LTL Formula:**  
a U (c & d)  

**Natural Language Translation:**  
This formula requires that:  
- **Eventually**, in some future state (possibly the current one), both `c` and `d` must be **simultaneously true**.  
- In every state **before** that moment (if it is not the current state), `a` must be **true**.  

**Key Implications:**  
- **Immediate satisfaction:**  
  - If both `c` and `d` are true **now**, the formula holds *immediately*, and `a` has **no constraint** (it can be true or false).  
- **Ongoing constraints:**  
  - If neither `c` nor `d` are both true now, `a` **must be true now**, and **continue to hold** in all subsequent states *until* the state where `c ∧ d` becomes true.  
  - Once `c ∧ d` becomes true, the constraint on `a` **ceases** (it no longer needs to hold afterward).  
- **Violations:**  
  - The formula fails if:  
    (a) `c ∧ d` **never becomes true**, or  
    (b) `a` **fails to hold** in any state *before* `c ∧ d` becomes true.  

**Examples:**  
- **Satisfied:** `[a, a, ¬a]` where `c ∧ d` is true in state 1 (`a` holds *until* state 1, and `c ∧ d` becomes true).  
- **Violated:** `[¬a, c ∧ d]` (state 0 fails `a`), or `[a, a, a, ...]` where `c ∧ d` never occurs.  

**Critical Clarification:**  
- `a` is **not required** in the state where `c ∧ d` holds—only in states *before* it.  
- Constraints **terminate permanently** once `c ∧ d` occurs.
