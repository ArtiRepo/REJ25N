**Original LTL formula:**  
`F (!y & w)`

**Rebuilding from the bottom up:**  
1. **`!y`**: "y is false."  
2. **`w`**: "w is true."  
3. **`!y & w`**: "y is false **and** w is true" (conjunction; both conditions must hold simultaneously).  
4. **`F (!y & w)`**: "**Eventually** (now or later), there exists a state where `!y & w` holds."  

**Refined natural language translation:**  
"The system must **eventually** reach **at least one state** where **y is false and w is true simultaneously**."

### Constraints and Satisfaction Conditions:  
- **When the constraint applies:**  
  - If neither condition is met initially (or if only one holds), the formula imposes a **future obligation**: a state where `y=false` and `w=true` **must eventually occur**.  
  - Until this state occurs, the system **cannot terminate/stop**, as the obligation remains unsatisfied.  
- **When the constraint is lifted:**  
  - Immediately **after any state satisfies** `y=false` **and** `w=true`, the formula is **satisfied forever** (no further constraints).  
- **Satisfied immediately if:**  
  - The **current state** has `y=false` and `w=true` (no future obligation needed).  
- **Violated if:**  
  - `y=false` and `w=true` **never occurs** (e.g., if `y` is always true when `w` is true, or `w` never rises when `y` falls).  

**Key highlights:**  
- **Single occurrence suffices** (it need not repeat).  
- **No restrictions outside the decisive state:**  
  - `y` and `w` can be **arbitrary** before/after the state where they satisfy `y=false ∧ w=true`.  
- **Critical dependency:** Both conditions **must coincide in the same state**. Separate states (e.g., `y=false` at time t and `w=true` at time t+1) **do not satisfy** the formula.  

Example:  
- ✅ Satisfied: `(y=T, w=F) → (y=F, w=T) → (y=T, w=F) → ...` (second state meets criteria).  
- ❌ Violated: `(y=T, w=T), (y=F, w=F), (y=T, w=F), ...` (no state couples `y=F` and `w=T`).  

---  
**Final phrasing:**  
"Eventually, **y is false and w is true at the same time**."
