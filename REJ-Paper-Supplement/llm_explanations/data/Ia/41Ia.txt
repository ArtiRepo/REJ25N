Here's a breakdown and translation of the LTL formula `G (n => s)`:

---

**Original LTL formula:**
`G (n => s)`

---

**Breakdown (parsing tree):**

*   The outermost operator is `G` (Globally / Always).
*   Its operand is the subformula `(n => s)`.
*   Inside `(n => s)`, the operator is `=>` (Implication).
*   Its left operand is the atomic proposition `n`.
*   Its right operand is the atomic proposition `s`.

---

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:**

1.  **Atomic Propositions `n` and `s`:**
    *   `n`: Represents a specific condition or event being true at a given moment in time. (e.g., "request received", "door open").
    *   `s`: Represents another specific condition or event being true at a given moment in time. (e.g., "service started", "safety lock engaged").

2.  **Implication `(n => s)`:**
    *   This subformula means "If `n` is true at the current moment, then `s` must also be true at the current moment."
    *   It is satisfied at a given moment if:
        *   `n` is false (regardless of `s`).
        *   `n` is true AND `s` is true.
    *   It is *violated* at a given moment *only if* `n` is true AND `s` is false.
    *   In natural language: "At this specific moment, `n` implies `s`." or "It's not the case that `n` is true and `s` is false right now."

3.  **Globally `G (n => s)`:**
    *   The `G` operator means that the condition it applies to must hold true at *every* moment in time, from the current moment onwards, forever.
    *   So, `G (n => s)` means that the implication `(n => s)` must be true at the current moment, and at the next moment, and at the moment after that, and so on, for the entire execution of the system.
    *   This means that at *no point in time* can the implication `(n => s)` be violated.

---

**Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:**

This LTL formula `G (n => s)` means:

**"Globally, if `n` is true, then `s` must also be true."**

More elaborately:

*   **Explanation:** This formula asserts a continuous, invariant relationship between `n` and `s`. It states that throughout the entire execution of the system, whenever the condition or event `n` occurs or is true, the condition or event `s` must *simultaneously* occur or be true.
*   **When the formula is satisfied:** The formula is satisfied if, at every single moment in time, one of the following holds:
    1.  `n` is false (in which case the implication holds vacuously).
    2.  Both `n` and `s` are true.
    It is *never* the case that `n` is true while `s` is false at the same moment.
*   **When it imposes constraints:** This formula imposes a strong, continuous safety constraint on the system. It forbids any state or situation where `n` is active or true without `s` also being active or true. It essentially says that `n` cannot happen independently of `s` in a way that `s` is absent.
*   **Intuitive phrasing:**
    *   "Whenever `n` happens, `s` must happen at the same time."
    *   "`n` always implies `s`."
    *   "`n` cannot occur without `s` also occurring simultaneously."
    *   "It is always forbidden for `n` to be true while `s` is false."
