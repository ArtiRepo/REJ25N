Here's a breakdown and translation of the LTL formula `X(!g | !j)`:

---

**Original LTL formula:**
`X(!g | !j)`

---

**Breakdown (parsing tree):**

*   The outermost operator is `X` (Next).
*   Its operand is the subformula `(!g | !j)`.
*   This subformula is a disjunction (`|`).
*   The left operand of the disjunction is `!g`.
*   The right operand of the disjunction is `!j`.
*   `!g` is a negation (`!`) of the atomic proposition `g`.
*   `!j` is a negation (`!`) of the atomic proposition `j`.

     |     |
     g     j
```

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:**

1.  **`g`**: Represents an atomic proposition, meaning "g is true" (e.g., "the gate is open").
2.  **`j`**: Represents an atomic proposition, meaning "j is true" (e.g., "the light is green").

3.  **`!g`**: This is the negation of `g`. It means "g is *not* true" or "g is false" (e.g., "the gate is closed").
4.  **`!j`**: This is the negation of `j`. It means "j is *not* true" or "j is false" (e.g., "the light is red").

5.  **`(!g | !j)`**: This is a disjunction (OR) of `!g` and `!j`. It means "either `!g` is true, or `!j` is true, or both are true."
    *   In simpler terms: "Either `g` is false, or `j` is false, or both `g` and `j` are false."
    *   An equivalent way to phrase this (using De Morgan's Law) is: "It is *not* the case that *both* `g` and `j` are true simultaneously." (`!(g & j)`)

6.  **`X(!g | !j)`**: The `X` (Next) operator applies to the entire `(!g | !j)` subformula. It means that the condition `(!g | !j)` must be true in the *very next state* (at the *next* moment in time) relative to the current state.
    *   Combining with the previous step: "In the very next state, either `g` is false, or `j` is false (or both)."
    *   Using the De Morgan's equivalent: "In the very next state, it is *not* the case that both `g` and `j` are true simultaneously."

**Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:**

This LTL formula means:

**"At the very next moment in time, it must not be the case that both `g` and `j` are true simultaneously."**

**Explanation:**

*   **When the formula is satisfied:** The system satisfies this formula if, when we observe the state immediately following the current one, we find that at least one of the propositions (`g` or `j`) is false. It is satisfied if `g` is false, or if `j` is false, or if both `g` and `j` are false in the next state.
*   **When it imposes constraints on the system over time:** This formula imposes an immediate constraint on the system's behavior. It dictates that the system *cannot* transition into a state where both `g` and `j` are simultaneously true. In the very next step, the system must ensure that either `g` is false, or `j` is false, or both are false. It prevents the scenario where `g` and `j` are *both* active in the immediate future.
