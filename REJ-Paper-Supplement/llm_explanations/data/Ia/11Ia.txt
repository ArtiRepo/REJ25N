Here's a breakdown and translation of the LTL formula `a U (b & c)`:

### Original LTL formula
`a U (b & c)`

### Breakdown (parsing tree)

The formula can be broken down into its constituent parts, showing their hierarchical relationship:

*   **Root Operator:** `U` (Until)
    *   **Left Operand:** `a` (Atomic Proposition)
    *   **Right Operand:** `(b & c)` (Compound Formula)
        *   **Root Operator:** `&` (And)
            *   **Left Operand:** `b` (Atomic Proposition)
            *   **Right Operand:** `c` (Atomic Proposition)

### Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up

Let's build the meaning step-by-step, starting from the simplest components:

1.  **`b`**:
    *   **Meaning:** Proposition `b` is true at the current moment.
    *   **Satisfaction:** Satisfied at a specific state if `b` holds in that state.
    *   **Constraints:** Imposes a constraint only on the truth value of `b` at the specific moment being considered.

2.  **`c`**:
    *   **Meaning:** Proposition `c` is true at the current moment.
    *   **Satisfaction:** Satisfied at a specific state if `c` holds in that state.
    *   **Constraints:** Imposes a constraint only on the truth value of `c` at the specific moment being considered.

3.  **`(b & c)`**:
    *   **Meaning:** Both proposition `b` AND proposition `c` are true *at the same moment*.
    *   **Satisfaction:** This subformula is satisfied at a specific state if `b` is true *and* `c` is true in that exact state.
    *   **Constraints:** It requires the simultaneous truth of `b` and `c` at any moment it is evaluated.

4.  **`a`**:
    *   **Meaning:** Proposition `a` is true at the current moment.
    *   **Satisfaction:** Satisfied at a specific state if `a` holds in that state.
    *   **Constraints:** Imposes a constraint only on the truth value of `a` at the specific moment being considered.

5.  **`a U (b & c)`**:
    *   **Meaning:** This is the "Until" operator. `X U Y` means that `Y` must eventually become true, and until `Y` becomes true, `X` must continuously hold. In our case, `X` is `a` and `Y` is `(b & c)`.
    *   **Satisfaction:** The formula `a U (b & c)` is satisfied at the current moment if there exists some future moment (which could be the current moment itself) where `(b & c)` is true. Furthermore, for all moments *from the current moment up to, but not including*, the moment where `(b & c)` becomes true, `a` must be true.
        *   **Scenario 1:** If `(b & c)` is true *right now*, the formula is satisfied (the "until `a`" part is vacuously true for preceding states, as there are none).
        *   **Scenario 2:** If `(b & c)` is not true now, but becomes true at some future moment `k`, then `a` must be true at the current moment, and at all subsequent moments `j` where `j < k`.
    *   **Constraints:**
        *   **Eventual Constraint:** It imposes a strong guarantee that the condition `(b & c)` (i.e., `b` and `c` being true simultaneously) *will eventually happen*. This is a liveness property.
        *   **Intermediate Constraint:** It imposes a continuous requirement that `a` must remain true *until* `(b & c)` occurs. If `a` becomes false at any point before `b` and `c` are simultaneously true, the formula is violated. This is a safety property for the intermediate states.

### Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity

Combining these insights, the LTL formula `a U (b & c)` means:

"**Eventually, both `b` and `c` will be true simultaneously. Until that moment arrives, `a` must continuously remain true.**"

**In simpler terms:**

*   We are waiting for a state where `b` and `c` are both active.
*   While we are waiting for that state, `a` must be active in every step.
*   If `b` and `c` are already active now, then `a` doesn't need to be active now (though it can be).
