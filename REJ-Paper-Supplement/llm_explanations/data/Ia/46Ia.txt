Here's a breakdown and translation of the LTL formula `F d | G !n`:

---

**Original LTL formula:**
`F d | G !n`

---

**Breakdown (parsing tree):**

```
        | (OR)
       / \
      /   \
    F d   G !n
    |      |
    d      !n
           |
           n
```

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:**

1.  **`n`**: This is an atomic proposition, meaning "proposition `n` is true at the current moment."
2.  **`!n`**: This is the negation of `n`, meaning "proposition `n` is *not* true at the current moment."
3.  **`d`**: This is an atomic proposition, meaning "proposition `d` is true at the current moment."
4.  **`F d`**: This is the "Eventually" operator applied to `d`. It means "proposition `d` will be true at some point in the future (including the current moment)."
    *   **Satisfaction:** This subformula is satisfied if, from the current moment onwards, there exists at least one state where `d` is true.
    *   **Constraint:** It imposes a liveness constraint: `d` *must* eventually occur. If `d` never occurs, this part of the formula is violated.
5.  **`G !n`**: This is the "Globally" operator applied to `!n`. It means "proposition `n` is *not* true at any point in the future (including the current moment)." In simpler terms, `n` never occurs.
    *   **Satisfaction:** This subformula is satisfied if, from the current moment onwards, `n` is false in every single state.
    *   **Constraint:** It imposes a safety constraint: `n` *must never* occur. If `n` ever occurs, this part of the formula is violated.
6.  **`F d | G !n`**: This is the "OR" operator combining `F d` and `G !n`. It means "either `F d` is true OR `G !n` is true."

**Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:**

This LTL formula states that **the system must ensure that one of two conditions holds true throughout its execution:**

1.  **Eventually, proposition `d` becomes true.** (It could be true now, or at any point in the future.)
2.  **Proposition `n` is never true at any point in time.** (It must be false now and remain false forever.)

**In simpler terms:**
"Either `d` will eventually happen, or `n` will never happen."

**When the formula is satisfied:**
The formula is satisfied if, from the current moment onwards, at least one of the following is observed:
*   There is some future state (or the current state) where `d` is true.
*   There is no state (from now on) where `n` is true.
*   Both of the above conditions are met.

**When it imposes constraints on the system over time:**
This formula imposes a disjunctive constraint. The system is considered compliant as long as it doesn't violate *both* conditions simultaneously.
*   It constrains the system such that it cannot *both* avoid `d` forever *and* allow `n` to occur at some point.
*   **If `d` never occurs**, then the system is constrained to ensure that `n` *must never* occur.
*   **If `n` does occur at some point**, then the system is constrained to ensure that `d` *must eventually* occur.
