Here's a breakdown and translation of the LTL formula `F (!y & w)`:

---

**Original LTL formula:**
`F (!y & w)`

---

**Breakdown (parsing tree):**

```
      F
      |
      &
     / \
    !   w
    |
    y
```

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:**

1.  **`y`**: This is an atomic proposition.
    *   Meaning: The condition `y` is true in the current state.
2.  **`!y`**: This is the negation operator applied to `y`.
    *   Meaning: The condition `y` is **false** in the current state.
3.  **`w`**: This is an atomic proposition.
    *   Meaning: The condition `w` is true in the current state.
4.  **`(!y & w)`**: This is the logical AND operator combining `!y` and `w`.
    *   Meaning: In the current state, `y` is **false** AND `w` is **true** simultaneously. This describes a specific state where both conditions hold at the same moment.
5.  **`F (!y & w)`**: This applies the "Finally" (or "Eventually") temporal operator to the subformula `(!y & w)`.
    *   Meaning: At some point in the future (including the current moment), the condition `(!y & w)` must become true.

**Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:**

This LTL formula means:

"**Eventually, `y` will be false and `w` will be true simultaneously.**"

**Explanation:**

*   **When the formula is satisfied:** The formula `F (!y & w)` is satisfied if, starting from the current moment, there exists *at least one* future state (which could be the current state itself) where the proposition `y` is false AND the proposition `w` is true at the same time. Once such a state is reached, the formula's requirement is fulfilled for that particular execution path of the system.

*   **When it imposes constraints on the system over time:** This formula imposes a **liveness constraint**. It dictates that the system *must* eventually reach a state where `y` is false and `w` is true. If the system continues to execute indefinitely without ever reaching such a state (i.e., `y` is always true, or `w` is always false, or they are never simultaneously `!y` and `w`), then the formula is violated. It guarantees that this specific combination of `y` being false and `w` being true will occur at some point in the system's execution.
