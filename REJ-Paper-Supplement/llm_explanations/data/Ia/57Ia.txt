### Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up

1.  **`a`**: This is a basic atomic proposition. It means "proposition `a` is true at the current moment."

2.  **`!a`**: This is the negation of `a`. It means "proposition `a` is false at the current moment."

3.  **`G!a`**: **Globally Not a**.
    *   **Meaning:** `a` must be false at the current moment and at all future moments. `a` must *never* occur from now on.
    *   **Satisfaction:** This subformula is satisfied at a state `s` if `a` is false at `s`, `s+1`, `s+2`, and so on, indefinitely.
    *   **Constraint:** If this holds, it imposes a strong safety constraint: `a` is permanently forbidden from this point forward.

4.  **`XG!a`**: **Next Globally Not a**.
    *   **Meaning:** In the *next* moment, `G!a` must be true. This means `a` must be false from the *next* moment onwards, forever.
    *   **Satisfaction:** This subformula is satisfied at a state `s` if `a` is false at `s+1`, `s+2`, `s+3`, and so on, indefinitely.
    *   **Constraint:** If this holds, it means that starting from the very next step, `a` is permanently forbidden.

5.  **`a -> XG!a`**: **If a, then Next Globally Not a**. This is an implication.
    *   **Meaning:** If `a` is true at the current moment, then `XG!a` must also be true at the current moment. In simpler terms: if `a` occurs now, then it must never occur again in the future. If `a` is false now, this part of the formula is vacuously true and imposes no constraint for the current moment.
    *   **Satisfaction:** This subformula is satisfied at a state `s` if:
        *   `a` is false at `s`.
        *   OR `a` is true at `s` AND `a` is false at `s+1`, `s+2`, and all subsequent states.
    *   **Constraint:** This imposes a conditional safety constraint: *if* `a` happens, it must be the *last* time `a` ever happens.

6.  **`G(a -> XG!a)`**: **Globally (If a, then Next Globally Not a)**.
    *   **Meaning:** The condition "if `a` is true, then it must never be true again" must hold at *every* moment in time. This means that `a` can occur at most once throughout the entire execution. If `a` never occurs, this part is satisfied. If `a` occurs, it must be the final occurrence.
    *   **Satisfaction:** This subformula is satisfied if, for every state `s` in the execution:
        *   `a` is false at `s`.
        *   OR `a` is true at `s` AND `a` is false at `s+1`, `s+2`, and all subsequent states.
    *   **Constraint:** This is a strong safety property: `a` is allowed to happen, but only once. Once `a` has occurred, it must never occur again.

7.  **`Fa`**: **Finally a**.
    *   **Meaning:** `a` must eventually become true at some point in the future (including the current moment).
    *   **Satisfaction:** This subformula is satisfied at a state `s` if there exists *some* future state `s'` (where `s'` is `s` or `s+1` or `s+2`, etc.) where `a` is true.
    *   **Constraint:** This imposes a liveness constraint: `a` *must* happen. The system cannot run indefinitely without `a` ever becoming true.

8.  **`Fa and G(a -> XG!a)`**: **Finally a AND Globally (If a, then Next Globally Not a)**.
    *   **Meaning:** Both parts of the formula must be true.
        *   `Fa` guarantees that `a` happens at least once.
        *   `G(a -> XG!a)` guarantees that `a` happens at most once.
        *   Combining these, `a` must happen *exactly once*. It must eventually occur, and once it occurs, it must never occur again.
    *   **Satisfaction:** The entire formula is satisfied if there exists a unique state `s_k` in the execution such that `a` is true at `s_k`, and `a` is false at all other states `s_j` where `j != k`.
    *   **Constraint:** This formula imposes a combined liveness and safety constraint:
        *   **Liveness:** The system *must* eventually reach a state where `a` is true.
        *   **Safety:** Once `a` becomes true, the system *must ensure* that `a` never becomes true again in any subsequent state.

### Refined Natural Language Phrasing for Clarity

The LTL formula `Fa and G(a -> XG!a)` means:

**"The proposition `a` must become true exactly once throughout the system's execution."**

More specifically:

*   **When the formula is satisfied:** The formula is satisfied if and only if there is a single, specific point in time when `a` is true, and `a` is false at all other points in time, both before and after that unique occurrence.

*   **When it imposes constraints on the system over time:**
    *   It imposes a **liveness constraint** (from `Fa`): The system is obligated to eventually reach a state where `a` is true. It cannot run forever without `a` ever occurring.
    *   It imposes a **safety constraint** (from `G(a -> XG!a)`): Once `a` has become true, the system must ensure that `a` never becomes true again in any subsequent state. This prevents `a` from re-occurring after its initial appearance.
