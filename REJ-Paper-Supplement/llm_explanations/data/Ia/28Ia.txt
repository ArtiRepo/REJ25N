### Rebuild Meaning from the Bottom Up

1.  **Atomic Propositions: `y`, `x`, `w`**
    *   **Meaning:** These are basic conditions or facts that can be either true or false at any given point in time (state).
    *   **Satisfied when:** `y` is true if the condition `y` holds in the current state. Similarly for `x` and `w`.
    *   **Imposes constraints on:** They represent the state of the system at a specific moment.

2.  **Subformula: `x & w`**
    *   **Meaning:** Logical AND. Both `x` and `w` must be true.
    *   **Satisfied when:** This subformula is satisfied in a given state if and only if *both* `x` is true *and* `w` is true in that *same* state.
    *   **Imposes constraints on:** It imposes a constraint on the *current* state, requiring `x` and `w` to hold simultaneously.

3.  **Subformula: `y => (x & w)`**
    *   **Meaning:** Logical Implication. "If `y` is true, then `(x & w)` must also be true."
    *   **Satisfied when:** This subformula is satisfied in a given state if:
        *   `y` is false in that state (the premise is false, so the implication holds vacuously, regardless of `x` or `w`).
        *   OR `y` is true *and* `(x & w)` is true in that state (both premise and conclusion are true).
        *   It is *only* violated if `y` is true *and* `(x & w)` is false.
    *   **Imposes constraints on:** It imposes a *conditional* constraint on the *current* state. If `y` is true, it *forces* `x` and `w` to also be true in that same state. If `y` is false, it imposes no constraint on `x` or `w`.

4.  **Full Formula: `X (y => x & w)`**
    *   **Meaning:** Temporal Next. The entire implication `(y => x & w)` must hold in the *next* state.
    *   **Satisfied when:** The entire formula is satisfied at the current state if and only if the subformula `(y => x & w)` is true in the *very next state* (the state immediately following the current one).
    *   **Imposes constraints on:** This formula imposes a constraint on the *future*. Specifically, it dictates that the conditional relationship "if `y` then `x` and `w`" must hold in the *next* time step. It says nothing about the current state, nor about any states beyond the immediate next one.

### Refine the Natural Language Phrasing for Clarity

"**In the very next moment in time, if condition `y` is true, then both conditions `x` and `w` must also be true simultaneously.**"

**Explanation of Constraints:**
This formula acts as a forward-looking requirement. It means that the system must ensure that whatever happens in the current state, the state that immediately follows it must satisfy a specific rule: if `y` is active in that next state, then `x` and `w` must also be active in that same next state. If `y` is not active in the next state, then `x` and `w` can be anything without violating this particular rule.
