Here's a breakdown and translation of the LTL formula `X (t | w)`:

---

**Original LTL formula:**
`X (t | w)`

**Breakdown (parsing tree):**

```
      X
      |
      |
      |
      |
      |
      ( | )
     /     \
    t       w
```

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:**

1.  **`t`**: This is an atomic proposition.
    *   **Meaning:** "Proposition `t` is true at the *current* state."
    *   **Satisfaction:** It is satisfied if `t` holds in the current state.
    *   **Constraint:** It asserts that `t` must be true at the current point in time.

2.  **`w`**: This is an atomic proposition.
    *   **Meaning:** "Proposition `w` is true at the *current* state."
    *   **Satisfaction:** It is satisfied if `w` holds in the current state.
    *   **Constraint:** It asserts that `w` must be true at the current point in time.

3.  **`(t | w)`**: This is a disjunction (OR) of the two atomic propositions.
    *   **Meaning:** "Proposition `t` is true OR proposition `w` is true at the *current* state."
    *   **Satisfaction:** This subformula is satisfied if `t` is true, or if `w` is true, or if both `t` and `w` are true, at the *current* state.
    *   **Constraint:** It imposes a constraint on the *current* state, requiring that at least one of `t` or `w` must be true.

4.  **`X (t | w)`**: This applies the "Next" operator (`X`) to the disjunction `(t | w)`.
    *   **Meaning:** "In the *next* state, proposition `t` is true OR proposition `w` is true."
    *   **Satisfaction:** The entire formula `X (t | w)` is satisfied at the *current* state if, when we look at the *very next state* in the system's execution, the condition `(t | w)` holds in that next state. That is, if `t` is true in the next state, or `w` is true in the next state, or both are true in the next state.
    *   **Constraint:** This formula imposes a constraint on the *immediate future*. It requires that the condition `(t | w)` must hold in the state that immediately follows the current state. It does not say anything about the current state itself, nor about any states beyond the very next one.

**Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:**

"**In the very next moment or state, it must be the case that either `t` is true, or `w` is true, or both are true.**"

**Explanation of when the formula is satisfied and when it imposes constraints:**

*   **Satisfaction:** This formula is satisfied at any given point in time (the "current" state) if, when you observe the system's state *immediately following* the current one, you find that `t` is true, or `w` is true, or both `t` and `w` are true in that subsequent state.
*   **Constraints over time:** This formula imposes a **one-time, immediate future constraint**. It dictates what must happen in the *very next step* of the system's execution. It does not place any requirements on the current state itself, nor on any states further in the future than the immediate next one. If the system reaches a state where, in the subsequent state, neither `t` nor `w` is true, then the formula is violated at the current state.
