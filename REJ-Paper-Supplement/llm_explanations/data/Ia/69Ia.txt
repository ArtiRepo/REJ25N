Here's a breakdown and translation of the LTL formula `FGa`:

---

**Original LTL formula:**
`FGa`

**Breakdown (parsing tree):**

```
      FGa
      / \
     F   Ga
         / \
        G   a
```

This tree shows that `FGa` is the "Eventually" (`F`) operator applied to the subformula `Ga`, and `Ga` is the "Globally" (`G`) operator applied to the atomic proposition `a`.

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:**

1.  **`a` (Atomic Proposition):**
    *   **Meaning:** "The condition 'a' is true at the current moment/state."
    *   **Satisfaction:** `a` is satisfied if the current state in the execution path satisfies the condition `a`.
    *   **Constraint:** This is a basic fact about the current state, not a temporal constraint on its own.

2.  **`Ga` (Globally `a` / Always `a`):**
    *   **Meaning:** "From the current moment onwards, the condition 'a' is always true."
    *   **Satisfaction:** `Ga` is satisfied if `a` is true in the current state, and `a` is true in the next state, and `a` is true in every subsequent state indefinitely along the execution path.
    *   **Constraint:** This imposes a strong constraint: `a` must hold continuously and without interruption for the entire future starting from the current point in time.

3.  **`FGa` (Eventually `Ga` / Finally `Ga`):**
    *   **Meaning:** "Eventually, it will be the case that 'a' is always true from that point onwards."
    *   **Satisfaction:** `FGa` is satisfied if there exists *some* future state (which could be the current state) from which the subformula `Ga` holds. This means there is a specific point in time after which `a` never becomes false again.
    *   **Constraint:** This formula constrains the system to eventually reach a state where `a` becomes permanently true. Before that specific point is reached, `a` can be true or false, but once that point is achieved, `a` must remain true for all subsequent states indefinitely.

**Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:**

The LTL formula `FGa` means:

"**Eventually, the condition 'a' will become true and remain true forever.**"

*   **When the formula is satisfied:**
    The formula `FGa` is satisfied if, at some point in the system's execution (which could be now, or at any future state), the condition `a` becomes true and never becomes false again for the rest of the system's lifetime. There must be a specific state in the path from which `a` holds continuously.

*   **When it imposes constraints on the system over time:**
    This formula imposes a strong liveness and stability constraint. It guarantees that the system will eventually settle into a permanent state where `a` is continuously active or true. Until that "settling" point is reached, `a` can fluctuate (be true or false). However, once the system enters the phase where `a` is always true, it must never transition out of it; `a` must hold indefinitely from that moment onwards. It's a guarantee of eventual, permanent stability for `a`.
