Here's a breakdown and translation of the LTL formula `b U (a | d)`:

---

**Original LTL formula:**
`b U (a | d)`

---

**Breakdown (parsing tree):**

*   The main operator is `U` (Until).
    *   Its left operand is the atomic proposition `b`.
    *   Its right operand is the subformula `(a | d)`.
        *   Inside `(a | d)`, the main operator is `|` (OR).
            *   Its left operand is the atomic proposition `a`.
            *   Its right operand is the atomic proposition `d`.

---

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:**

1.  **Atomic Propositions (`a`, `b`, `d`):**
    *   `a`: "Proposition 'a' is true at the current moment."
    *   `b`: "Proposition 'b' is true at the current moment."
    *   `d`: "Proposition 'd' is true at the current moment."

2.  **Subformula `(a | d)`:**
    *   This is a logical OR. It means: "At the current moment, either 'a' is true, or 'd' is true, or both are true."
    *   Simplified: "At least one of 'a' or 'd' is true at the current moment."

3.  **Full Formula `b U (a | d)`:**
    *   The `U` (Until) operator `P U Q` means that `Q` must eventually become true, and `P` must remain true at every moment *until* `Q` becomes true.
    *   In our case, `P` is `b` and `Q` is `(a | d)`.
    *   Therefore, the formula means:
        *   Eventually, the condition `(a | d)` (i.e., 'a' or 'd' is true) must become true. This includes the possibility that it's true right now.
        *   Until that moment when `(a | d)` becomes true, the condition `b` must continuously hold true.
        *   If `(a | d)` is true at the very first moment, then `b` does not need to be true at that moment for the formula to be satisfied (though it can be). The "until" condition is vacuously met.
        *   If `(a | d)` becomes true at some future moment `k` (where `k > 0`), then `b` must be true at all moments from the current moment up to `k-1`.

**Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:**

The LTL formula `b U (a | d)` means:

"**Eventually, either proposition 'a' or proposition 'd' (or both) must become true. Furthermore, until that specific moment arrives, proposition 'b' must continuously hold true.**"

**Explanation of when the formula is satisfied and its constraints:**

*   **When the formula is satisfied:**
    *   The formula is satisfied immediately if, at the current moment, either 'a' is true or 'd' is true. In this case, 'b' does not need to be true at the current moment.
    *   The formula is satisfied if there is some future moment in time where either 'a' is true or 'd' is true, AND at every single moment from the current time up to (but not including) that future moment, 'b' was continuously true.

*   **When the formula imposes constraints on the system over time:**
    *   **Future Obligation:** It imposes a strong guarantee that the system *must* eventually reach a state where 'a' is true or 'd' is true. If neither 'a' nor 'd' ever becomes true, the formula is violated.
    *   **Continuous Precondition:** It imposes a continuous constraint on 'b'. As long as 'a' or 'd' has not yet become true, 'b' *must* remain true. If 'b' ever becomes false *before* 'a' or 'd' becomes true, the formula is violated.
