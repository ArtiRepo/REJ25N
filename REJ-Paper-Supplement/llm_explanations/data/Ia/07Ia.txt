Here's a breakdown and translation of the LTL formula `a U c`:

---

### Original LTL formula

`a U c`

---

### Breakdown (parsing tree)

The formula `a U c` is a binary LTL operator (`U` for Until) applied to two atomic propositions, `a` and `c`.

```
      U
     / \
    a   c
```

*   **`a`**: An atomic proposition. It is true or false at any given moment.
*   **`c`**: An atomic proposition. It is true or false at any given moment.
*   **`U` (Until)**: A temporal operator that asserts that its right operand (`c`) will eventually become true, and until that happens, its left operand (`a`) must continuously remain true.

### Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up

1.  **`a` and `c` (Atomic Propositions):**
    *   `a` simply means "proposition `a` is true at the current moment."
    *   `c` simply means "proposition `c` is true at the current moment."

2.  **`X U Y` (General Until Operator):**
    The `Until` operator `X U Y` means that:
    *   There must be some future moment (which could be the current moment) when `Y` is true.
    *   At all moments *before* that specific future moment (including the current moment), `X` must be true.

3.  **`a U c` (Applying to our formula):**
    Combining the above, `a U c` means:
    *   There must be a future point in time (let's call it `t_c`) where `c` becomes true.
    *   At all time points from the current moment (`t_now`) up to, but *not including*, `t_c`, the proposition `a` must be true.
    *   Crucially, if `t_c` is the current moment (`t_now`), then `c` is true now, and `a` must also be true now.

### Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity

The LTL formula `a U c` translates to:

**"Proposition `c` will eventually become true, and until `c` becomes true, proposition `a` must continuously remain true."**

**Explanation of Satisfaction and Constraints:**

*   **When the formula is satisfied:**
    The formula `a U c` is satisfied at a given point in time (the "current" state) if and only if:
    1.  There exists a future state (which could be the current state itself) where `c` is true.
    2.  For all states from the current state up to (and including) the state *just before* `c` becomes true, `a` must be true.
    3.  If `c` is true at the current state, then `a` must also be true at the current state for the formula to hold.

*   **When the formula imposes constraints on the system over time:**
    This formula imposes two types of constraints:
    1.  **Safety Constraint (on `a`):** From the current moment onwards, `a` must be true in every state *as long as `c` has not yet become true*. If `a` ever becomes false *before* `c` becomes true, the formula is violated.
    2.  **Liveness Constraint (on `c`):** `c` *must* eventually become true. If `c` never becomes true at any point in the future, the formula is violated, regardless of whether `a` was continuously true or not.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine `a` means "the system is in a 'waiting' state" and `c` means "the 'start' button is pressed".

The formula `waiting U start_button_pressed` would mean:
"The 'start' button will eventually be pressed, and until it is pressed, the system must continuously remain in the 'waiting' state."

*   If the system leaves the 'waiting' state before the 'start' button is pressed, the formula is violated.
*   If the 'start' button is never pressed, the formula is violated.
*   If the 'start' button is pressed now, the system must also be in the 'waiting' state now.
