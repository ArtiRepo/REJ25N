Here's a breakdown and translation of the LTL formula `G t | F w`:

---

**Original LTL formula:**
`G t | F w`

**Breakdown (parsing tree):**

```
        OR
       /  \
      G t  F w
      |    |
      t    w
```

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:**

1.  **`t`**: This is an atomic proposition. It means "proposition `t` is true at the current moment."
2.  **`w`**: This is an atomic proposition. It means "proposition `w` is true at the current moment."
3.  **`F w` (Eventually `w`)**: This temporal operator means that `w` will be true at some point in the future, including the current moment. It asserts that there exists a state on the current path (starting from the current state) where `w` holds.
4.  **`G t` (Globally `t`)**: This temporal operator means that `t` is true at the current moment, and at the next moment, and at every subsequent moment forever. It asserts that `t` holds in all states on the current path (starting from the current state).
5.  **`G t | F w` (Globally `t` OR Eventually `w`)**: This is a logical disjunction (OR) between the two subformulas. For this entire formula to be true, at least one of its disjuncts must be true.
    *   Either `G t` is true (meaning `t` is always true from now on).
    *   OR `F w` is true (meaning `w` will eventually be true from now on).

**Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:**

This LTL formula means:

"**Either proposition `t` is true at all times from now into the infinite future, OR proposition `w` will eventually become true at some point in the future (including the present moment).**"

**When the formula is satisfied:**

The system satisfies this formula if, from the current moment onwards, one of the following conditions holds:

1.  **`t` is perpetually true:** The proposition `t` holds in the current state, and in the next state, and in every state thereafter, forever.
2.  **`w` eventually occurs:** There is at least one state on the execution path, starting from the current state, where the proposition `w` is true.

**When it imposes constraints on the system over time:**

This formula imposes a long-term constraint on the system's behavior, offering two alternative ways to satisfy it:

*   **If the system ever allows `t` to become false:** Then, to satisfy the formula, the system *must* ensure that `w` eventually becomes true at some point after `t` becomes false (or even before). The moment `t` fails, the system is committed to eventually achieving `w`.
*   **If the system never achieves `w`:** Then, to satisfy the formula, the system *must* ensure that `t` remains true at every single moment, forever.

Essentially, it's a "fallback" or "alternative guarantee." The system is required to either maintain a continuous state (`t`) or eventually reach a specific state (`w`). If it fails one, it *must* succeed at the other.
