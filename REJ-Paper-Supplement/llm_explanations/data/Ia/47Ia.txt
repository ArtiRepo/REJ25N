Here's a breakdown and translation of the LTL formula `a U (c & d)`:

---

**Original LTL formula:**
`a U (c & d)`

---

**Breakdown (parsing tree):**

This formula can be parsed as follows:

*   The main operator is `U` (Until).
*   The left operand of `U` is the atomic proposition `a`.
*   The right operand of `U` is the subformula `(c & d)`.
    *   This subformula `(c & d)` is a conjunction (`&`).
    *   Its left operand is the atomic proposition `c`.
    *   Its right operand is the atomic proposition `d`.

```
      U
     / \
    a   &
       / \
      c   d
```

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:**

1.  **`c`**: This simply means that proposition `c` is true at the current moment in time.
2.  **`d`**: This simply means that proposition `d` is true at the current moment in time.
3.  **`(c & d)`**: This is a conjunction. It means that both proposition `c` AND proposition `d` must be true simultaneously at the current moment in time.
    *   *Satisfaction:* This subformula is satisfied at a given moment if both `c` and `d` are true at that exact moment.
    *   *Constraint:* It imposes a constraint that `c` and `d` must co-occur.
4.  **`a U (c & d)`**: This is the Until operator. The formula `P U Q` means that `Q` must eventually become true, and until `Q` becomes true, `P` must be continuously true.
    *   Here, `P` is `a` and `Q` is `(c & d)`.
    *   Therefore, the formula means that the state where `(c & d)` is true must eventually be reached.
    *   Furthermore, at every moment *before* `(c & d)` becomes true (starting from the current moment), `a` must be true.
    *   Crucially, `a` does *not* need to be true at the exact moment `(c & d)` becomes true; its requirement ends just before that point.

**Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:**

This LTL formula means:

"**Eventually, both `c` and `d` will be true simultaneously. Until that specific moment arrives, `a` must be continuously true at every step.**"

**Explanation of when the formula is satisfied and its constraints over time:**

*   **Satisfaction:** The formula `a U (c & d)` is satisfied if there exists some future point in time (which can include the current moment) where both `c` and `d` are true. For all time points *before* this specific point (from the current moment up to, but not including, the moment `c & d` becomes true), `a` must be true.
    *   **Immediate Satisfaction:** If `c` and `d` are both true at the current moment, the formula is satisfied immediately. In this case, `a` does not need to be true at all, as the "until" condition is vacuously met.
    *   **Delayed Satisfaction:** If `c` and `d` become true at some future moment `k` (where `k > 0`), then `a` must be true at all moments `0, 1, ..., k-1`.
*   **Constraints on the system over time:**
    *   **Liveness Constraint:** The formula imposes a liveness property, guaranteeing that the system will eventually reach a state where `c` and `d` are simultaneously true. If this state is never reached, the formula is violated.
    *   **Safety Constraint:** It also imposes a safety property, dictating that during the entire period leading up to the `(c & d)` state, `a` must always hold. If `a` becomes false at any point before `c` and `d` are both true, the formula is violated.
    *   The constraint on `a` is temporary; it ceases to apply once `c` and `d` are both true.
