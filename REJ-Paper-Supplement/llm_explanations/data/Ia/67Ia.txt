### Rebuild Meaning from the Bottom Up

1.  **`a`**: This is an atomic proposition. It means "the condition `a` is true *at the current moment/state*."

2.  **`Fa`**: The `F` (Future/Eventually) operator means "eventually `a`." This translates to: "`a` will be true *at some point in the current state or any future state*." It's a guarantee that `a` will occur.

3.  **`XFa`**: The `X` (Next) operator means "in the next state." So, `XFa` means "in the very next state, `Fa` must be true." This translates to: "In the very next state, it must be true that `a` will eventually happen." This implies that `a` cannot happen in the current state to satisfy this formula; it must happen at some point *after* the current state.

4.  **`XXFa`**: Applying the `X` operator again, `XXFa` means "in the next state, `XFa` must be true." This translates to: "In the state two steps from now, it must be true that `a` will eventually happen." This implies that `a` cannot happen in the current state or the next state to satisfy this formula; it must happen at some point *after* the state two steps away.

### Refine the Natural Language Phrasing for Clarity

**Natural Language Translation:**
"Eventually, `a` will happen, but not before two steps from now."

**Explanation of Satisfaction and Constraints:**

*   **When the formula is satisfied:** The formula `XXFa` is satisfied at a given moment (or state `s0`) if, when we look at the state that is two steps into the future (let's call it `s2`), the condition `a` is true at `s2` or at any subsequent state (`s3`, `s4`, ...).

*   **When it imposes constraints on the system over time:** This formula imposes a constraint that guarantees the eventual occurrence of `a`. However, it specifically dictates that this occurrence *cannot* be in the immediate present (`s0`) or in the very next moment (`s1`). The earliest `a` can occur to satisfy this formula is in the state two steps from now (`s2`). If `a` never occurs at or after `s2`, the formula is violated.
