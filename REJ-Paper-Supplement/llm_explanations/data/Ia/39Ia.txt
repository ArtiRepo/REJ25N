Here's a breakdown and translation of the LTL formula `b U (d & a)`:

---

**Original LTL formula:**
`b U (d & a)`

---

**Breakdown (parsing tree):**

The formula can be parsed as follows:

```
      U
     / \
    b   &
       / \
      d   a
```

*   The main operator is `U` (Until).
*   The left operand of `U` is the atomic proposition `b`.
*   The right operand of `U` is the subformula `(d & a)`.
*   The subformula `(d & a)` is a conjunction (`&`).
*   The left operand of `&` is the atomic proposition `d`.
*   The right operand of `&` is the atomic proposition `a`.

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:**

1.  **`a`**: This simply means that proposition `a` is true at the current moment in time.
2.  **`d`**: This simply means that proposition `d` is true at the current moment in time.
3.  **`(d & a)`**: This is a conjunction. It means that *both* proposition `d` and proposition `a` must be true *simultaneously* at the current moment in time.
4.  **`b`**: This simply means that proposition `b` is true at the current moment in time.
5.  **`b U (d & a)`**: This is the `Until` operator. `X U Y` means that `Y` must eventually become true, and until `Y` becomes true, `X` must continuously hold.
    *   Applying this to our formula: `(d & a)` must eventually become true at some point in the future (or be true now).
    *   *And*, in all time steps *before* that moment when `(d & a)` becomes true (starting from the current moment), `b` must be true.
    *   If `(d & a)` is true at the current moment, then `b` must also be true at the current moment for the formula to hold.

**Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:**

This LTL formula means:

"**Eventually, a state must be reached where both `d` and `a` are true simultaneously. Until that specific state is reached (or if it's the current state), `b` must continuously hold true.**"

**Explanation of when the formula is satisfied and its constraints over time:**

*   **When satisfied:** The formula is satisfied if there exists some future point in time (or the current moment) where the condition `(d & a)` is true. Furthermore, for every moment *before* that point (starting from the current moment up to, but not including, the moment `d & a` becomes true), the condition `b` must have been true. If `(d & a)` is true at the current moment, then `b` must also be true at the current moment for the formula to hold.

*   **Constraints on the system over time:**
    *   **Future Goal:** The system is constrained to eventually reach a state where both `d` and `a` are simultaneously active or true. If `d` and `a` never occur together, the formula is violated.
    *   **Continuous Precondition:** Until that future goal (`d & a`) is met, the condition `b` must remain continuously true. If `b` ever becomes false *before* `d & a` becomes true, the formula is violated.
    *   **Immediate Check:** If `d & a` is true right now, then `b` must also be true right now.
