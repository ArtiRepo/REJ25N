Here's a detailed translation of the LTL formula `b U !d`:

---

**Original LTL formula:**
`b U !d`

---

**Breakdown (parsing tree):**

```
      U
     / \
    b   !
        |
        d
```

*   `b`: An atomic proposition.
*   `d`: An atomic proposition.
*   `!`: The negation operator.
*   `U`: The "Until" temporal operator.

---

**Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up:**

1.  **`b`**: This simply means that proposition `b` is true at the current moment in time.
2.  **`d`**: This means that proposition `d` is true at the current moment in time.
3.  **`!d`**: This means that proposition `d` is *not* true (i.e., false) at the current moment in time.
4.  **`b U !d`**: This is the "Until" operator. The formula `A U B` means two things:
    *   `B` must eventually become true at some point in the future (or at the current moment).
    *   Until `B` becomes true, `A` must be continuously true at every moment leading up to `B` becoming true (starting from the current moment).

    Applying this to `b U !d`:
    *   `!d` must eventually become true at some point in the future (or at the current moment). This means `d` must eventually become false.
    *   Until `!d` becomes true (i.e., until `d` becomes false), `b` must be continuously true.

---

**Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity:**

The LTL formula `b U !d` means:

"**Proposition `b` must remain true continuously until proposition `d` becomes false.**"

**Explanation:**

*   **When the formula is satisfied:**
    The formula `b U !d` is satisfied if there exists some future moment in time (which could be the current moment) where `d` is false, AND at every moment from the current time up to (but not including) that future moment, `b` was true. If `d` is already false at the current moment, then `b` must be true at the current moment for the formula to be satisfied.

*   **When it imposes constraints on the system over time:**
    This formula imposes two key constraints:
    1.  **Eventual Outcome:** It guarantees that `d` *will eventually become false* at some point in the future. The system cannot indefinitely keep `d` true.
    2.  **Intermediate State:** As long as `d` remains true, the system is constrained to ensure that `b` *must also be true* at every single step during that period. The moment `d` becomes false, the constraint on `b` is lifted for subsequent states.
