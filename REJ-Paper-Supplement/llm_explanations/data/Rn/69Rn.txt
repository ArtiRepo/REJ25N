### Translation and Explanation of the Formula **FGa**

**Formula:**  
`FGa` (interpreted as `F(Ga)` — "Eventually, `a` must **always** be true")

---

#### **1. When Constraints Apply**  
- **No immediate constraints** at the current state.  
- **Constraints begin** at some future state `k`:  
  - Once state `k` is reached, `a` **must be true in every subsequent state** (from `k` to infinity).  
- **Constraints never cease**:  
  - After `k`, `a` must hold **forever**. The formula does not "expire."  

#### **2. Evaluation Over Time**  
- **Initial evaluation**:  
  Formula is satisfied if there exists *any future state* `k` from which `a` is *permanently* true.  
  - If satisfied at state `0`, `k` could be the current state (`k=0`) or any future state.  
- **Truth-value evolution**:  
  - If `a` becomes permanently true at state `k`, the formula **holds for all time** (even before `k`).  
  - If `a` *never* stabilizes to `true` eternally, the formula is **violated**.  

---

#### **3. Satisfying Sequences**  
- **Scenario 1** (early stabilization):  
  `a` is false at state `0`, then becomes true at state `2` and **stays true forever** after.  
  - `k = 2` (constraints begin at `2`).  
- **Scenario 2** (immediate stabilization):  
  `a` is true at state `0` and **forever after**.  
  - `k = 0` (constraints apply immediately).  
- ✅ **Key**: `a` must eventually stabilize irreversibly to `true`.  

#### **4. Violating Sequences**  
- **Scenario 1** (never true):  
  `a` is always false.  
- **Scenario 2** (infinitely recurring false):  
  `a` alternates `true, false, true, false, ...` infinitely.  
- **Scenario 3** (temporarily true but later false):  
  `a` is true from state `1` to `100`, but becomes false at state `101` and beyond.  
- ❌ **Key**: No state `k` exists where `a` is **invariably true forever after**.  

---

#### **5. Common Misunderstandings**  
- **Not infinitely often**:  
  `FGa` **≠** "`a` is true infinitely often" (that would be `GFa`).  
  `FGa` demands `a` stays **permanently `true` after `k`**.  
- **Constraints are permanent**:  
  Once `k` is reached, the requirement "`a` must hold" persists **indefinitely** — it never stops applying.  
- **Freedom before `k`**:  
  Before `k`, `a` can be `true`, `false`, or fluctuate **arbitrarily** with no constraints.

#### **6. Summary of Translation**  
> "There must come a future point in time, starting from which **a becomes and remains true forever after**.  
> Before this point, **a can be anything** (no constraints). After it, **a must hold permanently**."  

**Equivalent phrasing**:  
> "Eventually, the system will reach a state where `a` locks to `true` and stays that way unconditionally."

**Key Distinction from Similar Formulas**:  
- Compare to `GFa` ("`a` holds infinitely often") — which allows `a` to flip after every occurrence.  
- `FGa` is **stronger**: It requires `a` to stabilize to `true` irreversibly.
