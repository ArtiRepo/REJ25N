### Translation and Explanation of the LTL Formula `!X t`

The formula `!X t` (equivalent to `¬X t`) imposes constraints on the **immediate next state** but **no constraints** on any other states, including the current state or states beyond the next.

#### Key Constraints:
- **Applies only to the next state**:  
  The formula requires that the variable `t` **must be false strictly in the state immediately following** the one at which the formula is evaluated.
- **Does not apply elsewhere**:  
  - The **current state** (where the formula is checked) has **no constraint** on `t`. `t` can be `true` or `false` in the current state.  
  - **After the next state**, the formula **ceases to impose any constraint** on `t`. For example, `t` can become `true` or remain `false` in later states without violating the formula.  
  - The formula imposes **no ongoing obligations** over time.

#### Evaluation Workflow:
1. **At the moment of evaluation** (e.g., at state `s₀`):  
   - Check the **next state** (state `s₁`) for the value of `t`.  
   - `!X t` is **satisfied at `s₀` if `t` is `false` in `s₁`**.  
   - `!X t` is **violated at `s₀` if `t` is `true` in `s₁`**.  
   - The value of `t` in `s₀` is **irrelevant**.  

2. **Evolution of truth value**:  
   - The formula’s truth is determined **only at the evaluation state** (e.g., `s₀`). It does not "evolve" over time beyond this check.  
   - Once the next state (`s₁`) occurs, the constraint is either satisfied (if `t=false` at `s₁`) or violated (if `t=true` at `s₁`).  

#### Satisfying vs. Violating Sequences:
- **Satisfying sequence** (at evaluation state `s₀`):  
  ```
  s₀: t = [any]   // e.g., t=true or t=false (no constraint)  
  s₁: t = false   // formula satisfied for s₀  
  s₂, s₃, ...: t = [any]   // no constraints  
  ```  
- **Violating sequence** (at evaluation state `s₀`):  
  ```
  s₀: t = [any]   // no constraint  
  s₁: t = true    // formula violated for s₀  
  ...  
  ```  

#### Common Misunderstandings:
- **Myth**: "`!X t` forbids `t` from being true indefinitely."  
  **Clarity**: No. The constraint applies **only to the next state**. States beyond `s₁` are irrelevant.  
- **Myth**: "The current state must satisfy `¬t`."  
  **Clarity**: The current state (`s₀`) is **unconstrained**. Only state `s₁` must have `t=false`.  
- **When the constraint ceases**: After the next state (`s₁`), the formula **no longer imposes any constraints** on `t`.

### Summary Translation of `!X t`
**"The formula requires that `t` is false in the very next state. The current state and all states beyond the next are unconstrained by this formula."**  

This establishes a **minimal, immediate obligation** for the system, confined exclusively to the state directly following evaluation.
