Based on the provided formula **X a & b**, here's a precise natural language translation adhering to your instructions:

---

#### **Formula Analysis:**
- **X a**: Requires proposition `a` to hold in the **immediate next state**.
- **b**: Requires proposition `b` to hold in the **current state**.
- **&**: Both operands must simultaneously hold as specified.

---

#### **Constraints Imposed:**
1. **Current state (`t = 0`):**
   - `b` **must be true**. If `b` is false, the formula fails immediately.
   - `a` is **unconstrained** (may be true or false).

2. **Next state (`t = 1`):**
   - `a` **must be true**. If `a` is false, the formula fails.
   - `b` is **unconstrained** (its value has no effect after `t = 0`).

3. **Beyond (`t ≥ 2`):**  
   No constraints on `a` or `b`. The formula stops imposing requirements after `t = 1`.

#### **Satisfaction vs. Violation:**
| **Time** | **Satisfying Sequence**          | **Violating Sequence**              | **Why?**                                                                 |
|----------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `t = 0` | `b = true`; `a` unconstrained    | `b = false`; `a` unconstrained      | Formula fails immediately if `b` is false at `t = 0`.                    |
| `t = 1` | `a = true`; `b` unconstrained    | `a = false`; `b` unconstrained      | If `a` is false at `t = 1`, the `X a` condition fails.                   |
| `t ≥ 2` | `a` and `b` unconstrained        | `a` and `b` unconstrained           | Constraints **cease** after `t = 1`.                                      |

---

#### **Key Points:**
- **When constraints apply:**  
  - `b` is strictly constrained **only** at the current state (`t = 0`).  
  - `a` is strictly constrained **only** at the next state (`t = 1`).  
- **When constraints cease:**  
  - `b`’s constraint ends immediately after `t = 0`.  
  - `a`’s constraint ends immediately after `t = 1`.  
- **Misunderstandings to avoid:**  
  - The formula **does not require** `a` to hold at `t = 0` or `b` at `t = 1`.  
  - The formula **imposes no obligations** beyond the first two states (`t = 0` and `t = 1`).  

---

#### **Natural Language Translation:**  
*"At the current moment, proposition `b` must be true. Additionally, in the very next moment, proposition `a` must be true. The formula places **no constraints** on `a` at the current moment, on `b` in the next moment, or on either `a` or `b` in any future moment beyond the immediate next state."*

---

This translates **X a & b** into a clear, temporally scoped requirement, explicitly delimiting when constraints are active and when they expire.
