### Translation and Explanation of the LTL Formula `a U b`

**Natural Language Translation:**  
"The formula `a U b` requires that `b` must eventually become true at some future state (which could be the current state). Until the state immediately before `b` becomes true, `a` must be true in every state. Once `b` becomes true (for the first time), the requirement for `a` is immediately lifted, and the formula imposes no further constraints on `a` or `b`."

#### Detailed Breakdown:
1. **Immediate Evaluation at the Current State (Time = 0):**
   - **If `b` is true now:**  
     The formula is immediately satisfied. `a` may be true or false at the current state (and in all future states) without affecting satisfaction. No constraints apply to `a` at any time.
   - **If `b` is false now:**  
     `a` must be true at the current state. The formula remains *provisionally unsatisfied* until `b` becomes true later.

2. **Constraints Over Time:**
   - **Phase 1 (Until `b` becomes true):**  
     `a` must hold continuously in every state from the current state until the state immediately preceding the first occurrence of `b`. `b` may be true or false in these states (except the final occurrence).
   - **Phase 2 (When `b` becomes true):**  
     At the first state where `b` becomes true:
     - `a` may be true or false (no constraint).
     - The formula is permanently satisfied.
   - **After `b` becomes true:**  
     No constraints apply to `a` or `b` in any subsequent states. The formula ceases to impose requirements.

3. **When Constraints Apply and Cease:**
   - **`a` is constrained:**  
     Only from the current state until the state **immediately before** the first occurrence of `b`.  
     *Ceases* as soon as `b` becomes true.
   - **`b` is constrained:**  
     Must be true at least once (either now or in the future).  
     *Ceases* after its first occurrence.

4. **Satisfying Sequences:**
   - **Example 1 (Immediate satisfaction):**  
     `b` is true at time `0`.  
     `a` can be arbitrary (e.g., `[b], [b, a, ¬b], [b, ¬a, b]`).
   - **Example 2 (Delayed satisfaction):**  
     `a` holds until `b` becomes true at time `2`:  
     `[a, a, b, ...]` → Satisfied at time `2`.  
     `a` is not required at time `2` or later (e.g., `[a, a, b, ¬a]` is valid).

5. **Violating Sequences:**
   - **Violation 1 (`b` never true):**  
     `[a, a, a, ...]` → Unsatisfied. `b` must eventually hold.
   - **Violation 2 (`a` fails before `b`):**  
     `[a, ¬a, b, ...]` → Unsatisfied. `a` must hold continuously until `b` occurs.

#### Key Clarifications:
- **Misconception:** "`a` must hold when `b` becomes true."  
  **Correction:** `a` is **not required** in the state where `b` becomes true. Only `b` is needed at that exact moment.
- **Misconception:** "`a` must hold forever if `b` never occurs."  
  **Correction:** If `b` never occurs, the formula fails regardless of `a` (since `b` is mandatory).
- **Temporal Scope:**  
  Constraints on `a` apply *only* between the current state and the state before `b`’s first occurrence. All states outside this interval are unconstrained.

**Summary Translation:**  
"`a U b` requires `b` to eventually become true. Until the moment before `b` first becomes true, `a` must hold continuously. Once `b` occurs, all constraints on `a` and `b` cease."
