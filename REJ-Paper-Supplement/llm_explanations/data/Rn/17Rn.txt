### Explanation for the Formula: `!G c`

**Translation:**  
"The formula `!G c` (which is equivalent to `F !c`) asserts that **eventually, at least once, `c` must be false**."

#### Key Constraints and Their Application:
1. **When Constraints Apply**:  
   - The formula imposes a constraint on the variable `c` **until a state occurs where `c` is false**.  
   - If `c` is already false in the **current state**, the formula is immediately satisfied → **no further constraint** on `c` applies in this or future states.  
   - If `c` is true in the current state, the formula requires that **`c` must become false in at least one future state**. Until that state occurs, the system is constrained to eventually make `c` false (though `c` can be true or false freely *prior* to that point).

2. **When Constraints Cease**:  
   - The **moment a state with `c = false` occurs**, the formula is satisfied → constraints on `c` **cease permanently** for the entire future. After this, `c` can be true or false with no impact on the formula.

#### Evolution of Truth Value:
- **Immediate Evaluation** (at time `t=0`):  
  - If `c` is **false** now, the formula is **satisfied immediately**.  
  - If `c` is **true** now, the formula is **not yet satisfied** — it depends on future behavior.  
- **Over Time**:  
  - If `c` later becomes false (at any time `t > 0`), the formula **becomes satisfied** and stays satisfied.  
  - If `c` **never becomes false**, the formula is **violated** (at all times).

#### Satisfying vs. Violating Sequences:
- **Satisfying Sequence** (formula holds):  
  - `[c=false, ...]` → Satisfied at `t=0`.  
  - `[c=true, c=true, c=false, ...]` → Satisfied at `t=2`. No constraints beyond `t=2`.  
  - `[c=true, c=false, c=true, c=true, ...]` → Satisfied at `t=1`. Values of `c` at `t≥2` are irrelevant.  

- **Violating Sequence** (formula fails):  
  - `[c=true, c=true, c=true, ...]` → `c` is **never false**. Formula is violated indefinitely.  

---

#### Clarification of Potential Misunderstandings:
- **Not a requirement for persistent falsehood**:  
  The formula **only needs `c` to be false *at least once***. After this, `c` may become true again freely.  
- **Constraint is time-limited**:  
  The formula **only constrains `c` until the first occurrence of `c=false`**. After this point, the constraint is lifted.  
- **Difference from `G !c`**:  
  `!G c` does **not** require `c` to be *always* false (unlike `G !c`). It allows `c` to be true arbitrarily often, as long as it is false at least once.

### Summary:  
**Natural Language Translation**:  
> "*The system must eventually have at least one state where `c` is false. Once this occurs, there are no further constraints on `c`. If `c` remains true forever, the formula is violated.*"  

**Core Implications**:  
- **Satisfaction condition**: `c = false` occurs at least once.  
- **Constraint scope**: Applies **only up to the first occurrence** of `c = false`; irrelevant afterward.  
- **Temporal scope**: The requirement exists **from the start** until satisfied or violated.
