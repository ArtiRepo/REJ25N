### Explanation of the Formula (c U a) & (b U a)  

This formula combines two "until" (U) conditions with a logical AND. The key requirement is that **both until conditions share the same critical event**: the occurrence of `a`. The formula is satisfied based on the timing of when `a` first becomes true. Below is a step-by-step analysis:

---

#### **Core Semantics**  
1. **Common Goal**:  
   `a` must eventually become true at some time \( T \) (where \( T \geq 0 \), starting from the **current state** at \( t_0 \)).  
   - If `a` is true **now** (\( T = 0 \)), the formula is immediately satisfied.  
   - If `a` is false now, `a` **must become true at some future time** \( T \) (where \( T \geq 1 \)).

2. **Constraints Before \( T \) (if `a` is not true now)**:  
   From the **current state** (\( t_0 \)) up to (but excluding) time \( T \) (i.e., \(\forall t \in [0, T-1]\)):  
   - **Both `c` and `b` must be true at every state**.  

3. **At and After \( T \) (when `a` first holds)**:  
   - At \( T \): `a` **must be true** (this satisfies both "until" conditions).  
   - The constraints on `c` and `b` **cease immediately** at \( T \) (and for all times after \( T \)), **regardless** of their values.  

---

#### **Key Concepts**  
- **Immediate Satisfaction (if `a` holds at \( t_0 \))**:  
  If `a` is true **now**, the entire formula is satisfied instantly.  
  - `c` and `b` can be **true or false now** (no constraint).  
  - No future constraints are imposed by this formula on `c`, `b`, or `a`.  

- **Deferred Satisfaction (if `a` holds later at \( T > 0 \))**:  
  The system must guarantee:  
  - `c` and `b` are **continuously true** from now until \( T-1 \).  
  - `a` becomes true **at \( T \)**.  
  - After \( T \), `c` and `b` are **unconstrained** and may become false or remain true.  

- **Constraint Lifespan**:  
  - `c` and `b` are **only constrained** between \( t_0 \) and \( T-1 \) (if \( T > 0 \)).  
  - The **moment `a` turns true** releases constraints on `c`/`b` **retroactively and prospectively**.  
  - No constraints apply **before \( t_0 \)**, or **after \( T \)**.  

---

#### **Satisfying and Violating Sequences**  
- **Satisfying Sequence** (example):  
  - Now: `a=false, c=true, b=true`  
  - Next: `a=false, c=true, b=true`  
  - Next: `a=true`  (at \( T=2 \))  
  *Explanation*: `c`/`b` held continuously from \( t_0 \) to `t=1` (`c`/`b` may change at or after `t=2`).  

- **Violating Sequence 1** (`a` never holds):  
  - `a` is **always false**.  
  *Result*: Formula violated (both `c U a` and `b U a` **fail**).  

- **Violating Sequence 2** (`c` or `b` fails before \( T \)):  
  - Now: `a=false, c=true, b=true`  
  - Next: `a=false, c=false, b=true`  
  - Later: `a=true`  
  *Result*: Formula violated because `c` failed at `t=1` before `a` occurred at `t=2`.  

- **Non-Violation** (`c` or `b` false after \( T \)):  
  - Now: `a=false, c=true, b=true`  
  - Next: `a=true`  
  - Later: `c=false, b=false`  
  *Result*: Formula **still satisfied**—constraints on `c`/`b` cease at \( T=1 \).  

---

#### **Common Misunderstandings**  
- **Not separate timelines**:  
  Both `c U a` and `b U a` **must be satisfied for the same \( T \)**.  
  - ✘ Incorrect: "`a` can occur at different times for `c` and `b`."  
  - ✓ Correct: A **single occurrence** of `a` ends constraints for **both** left-hand conditions.  

- **No constraints at or after \( T \)** (when `a` holds):  
  - The formula **does not require** `c`/`b` to hold at \( T \) or beyond.  

- **First occurrence of `a`** is critical:  
  If `a` becomes true multiple times, \( T \) is the **earliest moment** it becomes true.

### **Natural Language Translation**  
> "The formula (c U a) & (b U a) requires at least one of the following:  
> - **If `a` is true now**, the formula is satisfied immediately, and the current values of `c` and `b` are irrelevant.  
> - **If `a` is not true now**, then:  
>   (i) `a` must become true at some future time \( T \), and  
>   (ii) from now until the moment immediately before \( T \), **both `c` and `b` must be true at every intervening state**.  
>   
> Once `a` becomes true at \( T \), all constraints on `c` and `b` are permanently lifted—they may be true or false at \( T \) or any time after.  
> The formula is violated if `a` never occurs, or if `c` or `b` fails at any time before `a` first occurs."
