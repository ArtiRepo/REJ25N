### Translation and Explanation of the Formula: `!F (a & b)`

#### Core Translation:  
**"It is never the case in the future that both `a` and `b` are true simultaneously."**  
Equivalently: **"`a` and `b` must never both be true at any point from now onward."**

---

### Key Analysis:
1. **Constraint Application**:
   - **Applies**: The formula imposes constraints on `a` and `b` **for all future states** (including the current state if evaluated now).  
   - **Does Not Apply**: No constraints exist for events *before* the evaluation point. Past states are irrelevant.

2. **Immediate Evaluation**:
   - If evaluated at time `t`, the formula is **immediately satisfied** if `a` and `b` are **not both true** at `t` *and* will **never both be true** in any future state.  
   - It is **immediately violated** if `a` and `b` are both true at `t` *or* if they become true at any future state.

3. **Evolution Over Time**:
   - **Truth persistence**: Once satisfied, the formula remains satisfied forever *only if* `a & b` **never occurs** in subsequent states.  
   - **Irrevocable violation**: If `a & b` becomes true at *any* future state, the formula is **permanently violated** (even if `a` and `b` later become false).

4. **Temporal Constraints**:
   - `F (a & b)` requires `a & b` to occur **at least once** in the future.  
   - `!F (a & b)` **forbids** `a & b` from occurring **ever** (globally from now on).  
   - **No expiration**: The constraint applies **indefinitely**; it never "ceases" or "releases" the system.

### Satisfying vs. Violating Sequences:
| **Scenario**         | **Example Sequence**                     | **Explanation**                                                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Satisfying**       | `(a=⊥, b=⊥) → (a=⊤, b=⊥) → (a=⊥, b=⊤) → ...` | `a & b` never occurs. Formula holds forever.                                  |
| **Violating (Immediate)** | `(a=⊤, b=⊤) → ...`                      | `a & b` true at the first state → formula fails instantly.                     |
| **Violating (Future)**   | `(a=⊥, b=⊥) → (a=⊤, b=⊤) → ...`          | `a & b` becomes true later → formula violated at that state and remains false. |

### Common Misunderstandings:
- **"Never includes now"**: The constraint starts **immediately** at the evaluation point.  
- **No partial relaxation**: Unlike `U` (Until), there is **no point where constraints lift**. The prohibition applies **eternally**.  
- **Negation scope**: `!F` ≠ `G!`. Here, `!F (a & b)` **is equivalent to** `G!(a & b)` ("`a & b` is always false").  

---

### Summary Translation:
**"From the moment this formula is evaluated, `a` and `b` must never both be true at the same time, in any state now or in the future."**  

This expresses an **eternal safety constraint**: the system must **globally avoid** the simultaneous truth of `a` and `b`.
