### Translation and Explanation of the Formula `a U c` (a Until c)

**Natural Language Translation:**  
"`c` must eventually become true. Until that moment, `a` must hold continuously in every state starting from now. Once `c` becomes true, `a` is no longer required to hold."

---

#### Key Explanations:
1. **Immediate Evaluation (Current State):**  
   - **If `c` is true now:**  
     The formula is **immediately satisfied**. `a` may be `true` or `false` in the current state with no constraints.  
   - **If `c` is false now:**  
     `a` **must be true** in the current state. The formula then imposes future constraints until `c` becomes true.

2. **Constraints Over Time:**  
   - **Phase 1 (Until `c` becomes true):**  
     `a` must hold in **every state** from the current state onward until (but not including) the state where `c` first becomes true.  
     `c` must eventually become true at some future state.  
   - **Phase 2 (Once `c` becomes true):**  
     All constraints on `a` and `c` are **released**. `a` may be `true` or `false` afterward, and `c` may change freely.

3. **Transition of Constraints:**  
   - Constraints on `a` apply **only** from the current state until the state *immediately before* `c` becomes true.  
   - Constraints on `c` apply **only** until it becomes true for the first time.  
   - **After `c` becomes true:**  
     Neither `a` nor `c` is constrained by the formula. The system is free to evolve arbitrarily.

#### Satisfying Sequences:
- **Example 1 (Immediate satisfaction):**  
  `c=true` at the current state.  
  → `a` can be `true` or `false`; no future constraints.  
  **Sequence:** `[c=true]`, `[a=false, c=false]`, ...  
- **Example 2 (Delayed satisfaction):**  
  `a=true` now, `c` becomes true at a future state (e.g., state 2).  
  → `a` must hold in all states until state 1 (state before `c` becomes true).  
  **Sequence:** `[a=true, c=false]`, `[a=true, c=false]`, `[c=true]` (state 2).  

---

#### Violating Sequences:
- **Violation 1 (`c` never becomes true):**  
  `a` holds forever, but `c` never becomes true.  
  **Sequence:** `[a=true, c=false]`, `[a=true, c=false]`, ... (infinite)  
  → **Violation:** `c` must eventually hold.  
- **Violation 2 (`a` fails before `c` becomes true):**  
  `a` becomes false before `c` becomes true.  
  **Sequence:** `[a=true, c=false]`, `[a=false, c=false]`, ...  
  → **Violation:** `a` must hold continuously until `c` is true.  

---

#### Common Misunderstandings Clarified:
- **Constraint on `a`:**  
  `a` is **not required** in the state where `c` becomes true or afterward.  
  Example: `[a=true, c=false] → [a=false, c=true]` is **valid** (constraint on `a` ends *before* `c` becomes true).  
- **Constraint on `c`:**  
  `c` must become true **exactly once** (the first occurrence). Subsequent values of `c` are irrelevant.  
- **No Retroactive Constraints:**  
  The formula does not constrain states before the current state.

### Summary Translation:
"The formula `a U c` requires that **`c` eventually becomes true**. Until that moment, **`a` must hold continuously in every state** starting from now. Once `c` becomes true, **all constraints on `a` and `c` are lifted**."
