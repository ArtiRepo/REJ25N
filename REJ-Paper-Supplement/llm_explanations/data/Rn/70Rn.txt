### Translation and Explanation of LTL Formula: `G(a -> b)`

**Formula Translation:**  
"Globally, whenever `a` is true, `b` must be true in the same state."

---

### Key Explanations:

1. **When Constraints Apply:**  
   - **Constraint imposed:** Only when `a` is true.  
     - If `a` is true in a state, `b` **must** be true in that same state.  
   - **No constraint:** When `a` is false.  
     - If `a` is false, `b` can be either true or false without affecting the formula.  

2. **Evaluation Over Time:**  
   - **Immediate satisfaction:**  
     - At the moment of evaluation (e.g., the initial state), if `a` is true, `b` must be true.  
     - If `a` is false, the state satisfies the formula regardless of `b`.  
   - **Ongoing constraints:**  
     - The condition "if `a` is true then `b` is true" must hold **in every state** of the execution, forever.  
     - There is **no point** where this constraint ceases; it applies indefinitely.  

3. **Temporal Behavior of `G` (Globally):**  
   - `G(p)` requires `p` to hold **in every state** of the execution.  
   - Constraints apply **continuously** and **never expire**.  
   - Violation occurs if `p` fails **in any state**, even once.

### Satisfying vs. Violating Sequences:

**Satisfying Sequences:**  
- **Example 1:** `a` is never true.  
  - Sequence: `a=false, b=false` → `a=false, b=true` → `a=false, b=false` → ...  
  - **Why it satisfies:** When `a` is false, `a→b` is vacuously true.  
- **Example 2:** `a` is true only when `b` is true.  
  - Sequence: `a=true, b=true` → `a=false, b=false` → `a=true, b=true` → ...  
  - **Why it satisfies:** Every state where `a` holds also has `b` true.  

**Violating Sequences:**  
- **Example:** `a` is true in one state where `b` is false.  
  - Sequence: `a=false, b=true` → `a=true, b=false` → `a=false, b=true` → ...  
  - **Why it violates:** At the second state, `a` is true but `b` is false.

### Critical Misunderstandings Addressed:
- **"Constraints expire when `a` becomes false":** False.  
  - The constraint "if `a` is true then `b` is true" must hold **in every state**, regardless of past/future values.  
- **"`b` must hold forever if `a` ever holds":** False.  
  - `b` must be true **only in states where `a` is true**. If `a` is false in a state, `b` can be false.  
- **"The formula relates states":** False.  
  - `a→b` is evaluated **per state**. If `a` is true at state `i`, `b` must be true at state `i` (not earlier/later).

### Summary Translation:
"At every state in the execution, if `a` is true in that state, then `b` must also be true in the same state. When `a` is false, `b` may be true or false without restriction. This constraint applies perpetually to all states and is violated if any state exists where `a` is true and `b` is false."
