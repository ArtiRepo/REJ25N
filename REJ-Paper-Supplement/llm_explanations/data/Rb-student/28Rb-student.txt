### Translation of LTL Formula: \( X (y \rightarrow x \land w) \)

#### Step 1: Original Formula  
\( X (y \rightarrow x \land w) \)  
*(Uses \( \rightarrow \) for implication, equivalent to \( \implies \))*

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
- **Outermost operator**: `X` (temporal operator for "next").  
- **Child of `X`**: Implication \( \rightarrow \) with:  
  - **Left child**: Atomic proposition \( y \).  
  - **Right child**: Conjunction \( \land \) with:  
    - Left atomic proposition: \( x \).  
    - Right atomic proposition: \( w \).  

Tree structure:  
```
     X  
     |  
     →  
   /   \  
  y     ∧  
      /   \  
     x     w  
```

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up  
1. **Leaf level (atomic propositions)**:  
   - \( x \): Proposition \( x \) is true.  
   - \( w \): Proposition \( w \) is true.  

2. **Conjunction \( \mathbf{x \land w} \)** in the right child:  
   - Both \( x \) and \( w \) are true **simultaneously** in the same state.  

3. **Implication \( \mathbf{y \rightarrow (x \land w)} \)** as the parent:  
   - **Meaning**: If \( y \) is true, then \( x \) and \( w \) must also **both** be true.  
   - **If false?** Only violated if \( y \) is true but either \( x \) or \( w \) is false.  
   - If \( y \) is false, the implication holds regardless of \( x \) and \( w \) (no constraint).  

4. **Temporal operator \( \mathbf{X} \)** (next) applied to the implication:  
   - Constrains the **immediate next state** in the sequence.  
   - The condition \( y \rightarrow (x \land w) \) **must hold specifically in the next state**.  
   - **No constraint** on the current state or other future states beyond the next.  

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Phrasing  
- **Core meaning**:  
  > *"In the next state, if \( y \) is true, then both \( x \) and \( w \) must also be true."*  

- **Clarifications for precision**:  
  - The formula **only restricts the next state**—it says nothing about the present.  
  - If \( y \) is **false** in the next state, no requirements are imposed on \( x \) or \( w \) (they can be true/false).  
  - If \( y \) is **true** in the next state, **both** \( x \) and \( w \) must be true.  

- **When the formula is satisfied**:  
  - **Scenario 1**: Next state has \( y = \text{false} \) → formula holds (no matter \( x, w \)).  
  - **Scenario 2**: Next state has \( y = \text{true} \) **and** \( x = \text{true} \) **and** \( w = \text{true} \) → formula holds.  

- **When the formula is violated**:  
  - **Only possible when**: Next state has \( y = \text{true} \) but either \( x \) is false, \( w \) is false, or both.  

#### Final Natural Language Translation  
> **"In the immediate next state of the system, if \( y \) holds true, then both \( x \) and \( w \) must simultaneously hold true."**  

This captures:  
- Temporal constraint (`X` = next state).  
- Logical implication (if \( y \) then \( x \land w \)).  
- Strict requirement for \( x \land w \) to both be true when \( y \) is true.
