### Translation of LTL Formula: \( G\, (!f \mid !i) \)

#### Step 1: Original LTL Formula
\[ G\, (!f \mid !i) \]

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown
- **Top operator**: `G` (Globally)  
  - **Child**: Disjunction (`|`, logical OR)  
    - **Left child**: Negation (`!f`, not \( f \))  
      - *Leaf*: Atomic proposition \( f \)  
    - **Right child**: Negation (`!i`, not \( i \))  
      - *Leaf*: Atomic proposition \( i \)  

**Parsing Tree Structure**:  
```
     G  
     |  
     OR  
    /   \  
  NOT   NOT  
  /       \  
 f         i  
```

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up
1. **Atomic propositions**:  
   - \( f \): "Condition \( f \) holds (true)."  
   - \( i \): "Condition \( i \) holds (true)."  

2. **Negations**:  
   - \( !f \): "Condition \( f \) is **false**."  
   - \( !i \): "Condition \( i \) is **false**."  

3. **Disjunction (OR)**:  
   - \( !f \mid !i \): "**Either \( f \) is false, or \( i \) is false, or both**."  
     *Equivalent to*: "It is **not** the case that both \( f \) and \( i \) are true simultaneously."  

4. **Globally (G)**:  
   - \( G\, (!f \mid !i) \):  
     "**At every future moment**, either \( f \) is false, or \( i \) is false, or both."  
     *Meaning*: "**For all time, \( f \) and \( i \) are mutually exclusive**—they can never both be true at the same time."  

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Phrasing
> **Final Translation**:  
> *"The conditions \( f \) and \( i \) are mutually exclusive at all times: it is never permitted for both to be true simultaneously."*  

##### Key Implications:
- **When satisfied**:  
  The system ensures that \( f \) and \( i \) **never co-occur** in any state.  
  - Example valid traces:  
    - \( f = \text{false}, i = \text{false}, \dots \)  
    - \( f = \text{true}, i = \text{false}, \dots \)  
    - \( f = \text{false}, i = \text{true}, \dots \)  
  - Violations occur **the instant both \( f \) and \( i \) are true** at the same time.  

- **Why this phrasing?**  
  - Uses **"mutually exclusive"** for clarity (common in formal specifications).  
  - Explicitly states the **temporal constraint** ("at all times") from \( G \).  
  - Avoids ambiguity of disjunction (e.g., "either not \( f \) or not \( i \)" is less intuitive).  

##### Equivalent Logic (for verification):
- \( G\, (!f \mid !i) \equiv G\, \neg(f \land i) \)  
  *("Always, \( f \) and \( i \) do not occur together")*.
