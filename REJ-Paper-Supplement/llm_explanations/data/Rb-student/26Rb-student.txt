### Translation of LTL Formula: \( \mathbf{X} \, t \Rightarrow \mathbf{X} \, y \)

#### Step 1: Original LTL Formula  
\[ \mathbf{X} \, t \Rightarrow \mathbf{X} \, y \]

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
The formula has a hierarchical structure:  
- **Root operator**: Implication (\(\Rightarrow\))  
  - **Left child**: Next operator (\(\mathbf{X}\))  
    - *Leaf*: Atomic proposition \(t\) (e.g., "task starts")  
  - **Right child**: Next operator (\(\mathbf{X}\))  
    - *Leaf*: Atomic proposition \(y\) (e.g., "system ready")  

**Tree Visualization**:  
```
      ⇒
     / \
    X   X
    |   |
    t   y
```

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up  
1. **Leaf-level meaning**:  
   - \(t\): Represents a Boolean proposition (e.g., "task starts" being true at a specific time).  
   - \(y\): Represents another Boolean proposition (e.g., "system ready" being true).  

2. **Next operator (\(\mathbf{X}\)) semantics**:  
   - \(\mathbf{X} \, t\): "\(t\) is true **in the immediate next state**."  
     - *Example*: "The task starts at the next timestep."  
   - \(\mathbf{X} \, y\): "\(y\) is true **in the immediate next state**."  
     - *Example*: "The system is ready at the next timestep."  

3. **Implication (\(\Rightarrow\)) semantics**:  
   - \(\mathbf{X} \, t \Rightarrow \mathbf{X} \, y\):  
     - If \(\mathbf{X} \, t\) is true (**next state satisfies \(t\)**), then \(\mathbf{X} \, y\) **must** be true (**next state must also satisfy \(y\)**).  
     - If \(\mathbf{X} \, t\) is false (**next state does not satisfy \(t\)**), the formula is **automatically satisfied** (no constraint on \(y\)).  

**Satisfaction conditions**:  
- The formula is **violated** only when:  
  - \(t\) is true **in the next state**, but \(y\) is **false** there.  
- The formula is **satisfied** in all other cases:  
  - \(t\) is false in the next state (regardless of \(y\)), or  
  - Both \(t\) and \(y\) are true in the next state.  

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Phrasing  
**Literal translation**:  
> "If \(t\) is true in the next state, then \(y\) must be true in that **same** next state."  

**More intuitive phrasing** (contextual example):  
> "Whenever the system enters a state where \(t\) holds (e.g., 'task starts'), in the **very next moment**, \(y\) (e.g., 'system ready') must also hold."  

**Key clarifications**:  
- **Temporal scope**: Only constrains the **immediate next state**.  
- **No future constraints**: States beyond the next are irrelevant.  
- **No dependency on the current state**: The formula speaks purely about the next state.  

**Practical implications**:  
- If the system ever encounters a state where \(t\) is true and \(y\) is false (at timestep \(n+1\)), the formula is breached.  
- Allows "vacuous satisfaction" if \(t\) is false in the next state.  

### Final Natural Language Translation  
> "If \(t\) holds in the immediate next state, then \(y\) must also hold in that same state."
