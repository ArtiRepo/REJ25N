### Translation of LTL Formula: **G (n => s)**  
**Original Formula:**  
`G (n => s)`

---

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:  
#### 1. **Parsing Tree Breakdown:**  
- **Top operator:** `G` (Global/Always)  
  - **Child:** `(n => s)` (Implication)  
    - **Left child:** `n` (Atomic proposition, e.g., "alarm is triggered")  
    - **Right child:** `s` (Atomic proposition, e.g., "system shuts down")  

#### 2. **Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up:**  
- **Leaves (Atomic Propositions):**  
  - `n`: Represents a specific condition (e.g., "a fault occurs").  
  - `s`: Represents another condition (e.g., "a safety protocol starts").  

- **Implication (`n => s`):**  
  - Logically: "If `n` is true **in the current state**, then `s` must **also be true in the current state**."  
  - Example: *"If a fault occurs **now**, the safety protocol must activate **now**."*  

- **Global Operator (`G`):**  
  - Applies to the entire formula `n => s`, enforcing it **for all future states**.  
  - Meaning: "The implication `n => s` must hold **at every point in time**."  

#### 3. **Combined Meaning:**  
`G (n => s)` translates to:  
> **"For all states in the future:**  
> If `n` is true **in any state**, then `s` must be true **in that same state**."  

#### 4. **Key Nuances:**  
- **Synchronization:** `n` and `s` are constrained to the **same state** (i.e., the response `s` is instantaneous if `n` occurs).  
- **Safety Guarantee:** If `n` happens at time *t*, `s` **must** be true at *t*. Delayed responses violate the formula.  
- **Vacuous Satisfaction:** If `n` **never** occurs, the formula holds by default (no constraints on `s` when `n` is false).

### Refined Natural Language Phrasing:  
> **"Throughout the system's execution, whenever `n` holds (e.g., an event occurs), `s` must simultaneously hold in the same moment. No delay is permitted."**  

#### Clarifications:  
- **Concrete Example:**  
  - If `n` = "overheating" and `s` = "cooling system activates":  
    *"The system must activate cooling **immediately (in the same state)** whenever overheating is detected."*  
- **Constraint vs. Flexibility:**  
  - The formula **does not** require `n` to ever occur (it allows cases where `n` is always false).  
  - It **forbids** states where `n` is true but `s` is false.  

#### Why "simultaneously"?  
LTL evaluates propositions per state. Thus, "in the same state" implies no temporal gap between `n` and `s`. This is stricter than `n => F s` (which would allow delays).

**Final Translation:**  
**"Always, if n is true now, then s must be true now."**
