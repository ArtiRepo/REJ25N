### Reasoned Translation of LTL Formula: `(c U a) & (b U a)`

#### Step 1: Original LTL Formula  
`(c U a) & (b U a)`

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
The formula is a **conjunction** (`&`) of two **"Until" (U)** subformulas:  
```
      &
     / \
    U   U
   / \ / \
  c   a b a
```  
- **Left operand**: `c U a` ("c **Until** a").  
- **Right operand**: `b U a` ("b **Until** a").  

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up  
1. **Interpret subformulas**:  
   - `c U a`: 
     - **Requires** that `a` **eventually becomes true** at some future time.  
     - **Until `a` holds**, `c` **must be true at every preceding step** (including the current state if `a` is false now).  
     - *Example*: If `a` becomes true at time `t=3`, then `c` is true at `t=0,1,2`. If `a` is true now, `c` is unconstrained at the current step.  

   - `b U a`:  
     - Same as above but for `b`: `a` **must eventually become true**, and `b` **holds continuously until then**.  

2. **Combine with conjunction (`&`)**:  
   - Both `(c U a)` and `(b U a)` **must hold simultaneously**.  
   - This requires:  
     - `a` **must become true eventually** (required by both `U` operands).  
     - **Until `a` holds**, **both `c` and `b`** must be true **at every step** where `a` is not yet true.  
   - **Key equivalence**:  
     `(c U a) & (b U a)` ≡ `(c ∧ b) U a`.  
     (Proof: Both sides require `a` eventually true, and until then, `c` and `b` both hold.)  

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Translation  
The formula imposes two constraints over the system:  
1. **Eventuality of `a`**:  
   - The system **must eventually reach a state** where `a` is true.  
   - If `a` is already true, this condition is satisfied immediately.  

2. **Continuity of `b` and `c` until `a`**:  
   - From the **current state** up to **(but excluding)** the state where `a` *first* becomes true:  
     - `b` **must be true in every state**.  
     - `c` **must be true in every state**.  
   - After `a` holds, `b` and `c` are unconstrained.  

**Refined phrasing**:  
> "*Eventually, `a` becomes true, and until that moment, both `b` and `c` are always true.*"  

**Explanation of constraints**:  
- **When `a` is already true**:  
  - No constraints on `b` or `c` at the current state. The formula is satisfied.  
- **When `a` is not yet true**:  
  - `b` and `c` **must both be true** in the **current state and all subsequent states** until the exact moment `a` becomes true.  
  - If `a` **never occurs**, the formula is **violated** (due to `U` requiring eventual `a`).  
  - If `b` or `c` **fails in any state before `a`**, the formula is violated.  

**Why use "until" phrasing?**  
The natural language "until" implicitly includes:  
- Eventuality: `a` *must* occur.  
- Continuous requirement: `b` and `c` hold at every step before `a`.  
This aligns precisely with the formal semantics of LTL's `U` operator.  

#### Final Translation  
**Formula**: `(c U a) & (b U a)`  
**Meaning**:  
> *"Eventually, `a` becomes true. Until then, both `b` and `c` are always true."*
