### Translation of the LTL Formula: \( b \; \mathbf{U} \; (a \mid d) \)

#### Step 1: Original Formula  
The given LTL formula is:  
\[ b \; \mathbf{U} \; (a \lor d) \]  
(Here, \( \mid \) is equivalent to \( \lor \), representing **disjunction**.)

---

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree  
The formula can be broken down into a tree structure:  
```
        U (Until)
       /   \
      /     \
     b      ∨ (Disjunction)
           / \
          a   d
```  
- **Leaf nodes**: Atomic propositions \( a \) and \( d \).  
- **Disjunction (\( \lor \))**: Combines \( a \) and \( d \) to form the subformula \( a \lor d \).  
- **Until (\( \mathbf{U} \))**: Takes \( b \) (left child) and \( a \lor d \) (right child) as operands.  

---

#### Step 3: Bottom-Up Meaning Reconstruction  

1. **Atomic propositions (Leaves)**:
   - \( a \): "Proposition \( a \) is true at the current moment."  
   - \( d \): "Proposition \( d \) is true at the current moment."  

2. **Disjunction (\( a \lor d \))**:
   - Meaning: "**At least one** of \( a \) or \( d \) is true at the current moment."  
   - Formal: True if \( a \) holds, \( d \) holds, or both hold.  

3. **Until (\( b \; \mathbf{U} \; (a \lor d) \))**:
   - **Standard LTL semantics**: The formula \( b \; \mathbf{U} \; \phi \) is satisfied **if and only if**:  
     - There exists a **future moment** \( j \) (starting from the current moment \( i \)) where \( \phi \) holds (here, \( \phi = a \lor d \)).  
     - **For all moments** \( k \) from \( i \) up to **but excluding** \( j \), \( b \) holds.  
   - Key points:
     - \( a \lor d \) **must eventually become true** at some future time \( j \) (strong guarantee).  
     - \( b \) must hold **continuously** from the current moment up to (but **not including**) \( j \).  
     - If \( a \lor d \) is **already true** at the current moment (\( j = i \)), \( b \) is **not required** (the interval \([i, j-1]\) is empty).  

   **Summary**:  
   "\( b \) must hold continuously from now until **just before** the moment where \( a \) or \( d \) becomes true. Additionally, **at least one of \( a \) or \( d \) must eventually become true**."  

---

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Phrasing  
To make the translation clear and unambiguous:  

> "**Eventually, \( a \) or \( d \) becomes true, and \( b \) holds continuously until the moment immediately before that happens.**"  

**Clarifications**:  
- **Continuity of \( b \)**: \( b \) must hold **without interruption** from the current time up to (but **excluding**) the moment \( a \) or \( d \) becomes true.  
- **Eventual occurrence**: The formula **fails** if neither \( a \) nor \( d \) ever becomes true.  
- **Current-state handling**: If \( a \) or \( d \) is **already true now**, the requirement for \( b \) is **trivially satisfied** (no obligation for \( b \) at the current moment).  

**Constraints over time**:  
- **If \( a \lor d \) is not true now**: \( b \) must start holding immediately and persist unbroken until the system transitions to a state where \( a \lor d \) is true.  
- **If \( a \lor d \) becomes true at time \( j \)**: \( b \) must hold for all times \( < j \), but \( b \) **may become false at \( j \)**.  

---

**Final Natural Language Translation**:  
> "\( b \) remains true continuously until the step just before \( a \) or \( d \) becomes true, and eventually \( a \) or \( d \) must become true."
