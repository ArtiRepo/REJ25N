### Translation of LTL Formula: XXFXa

**Original LTL Formula:**  
XXFXa

---

### Parsing Tree Breakdown
To interpret the formula, we break it down into its structural components using a parsing tree. The operators associate from right to left, as they are unary and prefix-based (e.g., `X` applies to the immediately following formula). The formula is parsed as:  
`X( X( F( X(a) ) )`

**Parsing Tree Representation:**  
```
        X (outermost)
          |
          X
          |
          F
          |
          X
          |
          a (atomic proposition)
```

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**  
1. **Atomic Proposition (`a`):**  
   Represents a basic state (e.g., "the system satisfies property `a`").

2. **Innermost X (`Xa`):**  
   `X(a)` means "`a` holds **in the next state**" relative to the current evaluation point.

3. **F Operator (`F(Xa)`):**  
   `F(Xa)` means "**eventually**, in some future state, `Xa` holds" (i.e., "eventually, the very next state satisfies `a`").

4. **Middle X (`X(F(Xa))`):**  
   `X(F(Xa))` means "**in the next state**, `F(Xa)` will hold" (i.e., "starting from the next state, it will eventually become true that `a` holds one state later").

5. **Outermost X (`X(X(F(Xa)))`):**  
   `X(X(F(Xa)))` means "**in the next state**, the formula `X(F(Xa))` will hold".

### Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up
We now reconstruct the semantics chronologically, starting from the current state (state 0):

| **Subformula** | **Evaluation Result** |
|----------------|------------------------|
| `a` | "`a` is true in some state." |
| `X(a)` | "In the **next state**, `a` is true." |
| `F(Xa)` | "**Eventually**, at some future state `k` (≥ current time), the **immediately following state** (k+1) satisfies `a`." |
| `X(F(Xa))` | "Starting from the **next state** (state 1), `F(Xa)` holds: meaning, at state 1, it becomes true that <br> **eventually** (at state `m ≥ 1`), the state **right after `m`** (state `m+1`) satisfies `a`." |
| `X(X(F(Xa)))` | "Starting from the **next state** (state 1), `X(F(Xa))` holds: meaning, at state 1, the formula requires that <br> at **the next state after that** (state 2), `F(Xa)` becomes true." |

**Concrete Timeline:**  
- **At state 0:** The formula `XXFXa` is evaluated.  
- **At state 1:** `X(F(Xa))` must hold (i.e., state 1 expects `F(Xa)` to hold **from state 2 onward**).  
- **At state 2:** `F(Xa)` must hold. This means:  
  - *There exists a state `m ≥ 2`* such that at state `m`, `Xa` holds.  
- **At state `m` (≥ 2):** `Xa` holds, meaning `a` **must hold at state `m+1`**.  

**Key Constraint:**  
Since `m ≥ 2`, the soonest `m+1` can occur is **state 3**. Thus, `a` **must become true at some state ≥ 3**.

### Natural Language Translation
- **Base Translation:**  
  "Eventually, **at least three states from now**, `a` holds true."  

- **Refined for Clarity:**  
  "**Starting from now, after the next two states**, it is guaranteed that `a` will **eventually become true** in **a subsequent state** (which is at least the third state from now)."  

- **Key Implications:**  
  - The system has **no obligation** for `a` to hold at states 0, 1, or 2.  
  - The constraint **activates after the second state**, requiring `a` to appear at some point **beyond state 2** (minimally, at state 3).  
  - If `a` holds at state 3 or later, the formula is satisfied.  

**Why this phrasing?**  
- `XX` forces the focus **two states ahead**.  
- `FXa` requires that **after that point**, `a` appears **one state later than some future time**.  
- The combination ensures `a` **cannot occur sooner than state 3**.

### Final Natural Language Statement  
"**There is a future time at least three states from the current state at which `a` is true.**"
