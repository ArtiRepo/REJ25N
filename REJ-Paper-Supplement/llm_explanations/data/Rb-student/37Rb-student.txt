### Translation of LTL Formula: \( G (\neg i) \lor F (f \mathbin{\mathcal{U}} i) \)

**Step 1: Original LTL Formula**  
\( G (\neg i) \lor F (f \mathbin{\mathcal{U}} i) \)

**Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown**  
The formula is a disjunction (\(\lor\)) of two subformulas:  
- **Left subformula**: \( G (\neg i) \)  
  - \( G \): "Globally" operator (for all future states)  
  - \( \neg i \): Negation of atomic proposition \( i \)  
- **Right subformula**: \( F (f \mathbin{\mathcal{U}} i) \)  
  - \( F \): "Eventually" operator (there exists a future state)  
  - \( f \mathbin{\mathcal{U}} i \): "Until" operator (with \( f \) and \( i \) as subformulas)  
    - \( f \): Atomic proposition  
    - \( i \): Atomic proposition  

**Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning from Bottom Up**  
- **Atomic propositions**:  
  - \( i \): A system state or event (e.g., "the system enters state \( i \)").  
  - \( f \): A system state or event (e.g., "the system is in state \( f \)").  
- **Composite formulas**:  
  1. \( \neg i \): "\( i \) does not hold."  
  2. \( G (\neg i) \): "Globally \( \neg i \)" → "\( i \) **never** holds (at any future time)."  
  3. \( f \mathbin{\mathcal{U}} i \): "Until" → "\( f \) holds continuously **until** a state where \( i \) holds."  
     - Requires:  
       - \( i \) **must eventually hold** at some future time \( k \).  
       - For all times between the starting point and \( k \), \( f \) holds.  
  4. \( F (f \mathbin{\mathcal{U}} i) \): "Eventually until" → "There **exists a future time** from which \( f \) holds continuously until \( i \) holds."  
     - Critically, this includes trivial/vacuous cases where \( i \) holds immediately at the starting time.  

**Key Insight**:  
- \( F (f \mathbin{\mathcal{U}} i) \) simplifies to **"\( i \) eventually holds"**:  
  - If \( i \) holds at time \( t \), we set the starting time of \( \mathcal{U} \) to \( t \).  
  - The interval \([t, t)\) (duration 0) is **vacuously true** for \( f \mathbin{\mathcal{U}} i \) since no prior states need \( f \).  
  - Thus, \( F (f \mathbin{\mathcal{U}} i) \equiv F(i) \), and \( f \) **does not constrain** the behavior.  

**Rebuilt Formula Semantics**:  
- \( G (\neg i) \lor \mathbf{F}(i) \)  
  - \( G (\neg i) \): "\( i \) never occurs."  
  - \( F (i) \): "\( i \) eventually occurs at least once."  
- **Mutually exclusive and exhaustive scenarios**:  
  - Either \( i \) **never** happens, or it **eventually** happens.  
- **Result**:  
  The formula asserts **no meaningful constraints** over infinite traces:  
  - For any system, \( i \) either never occurs or occurs eventually.  
  - This is a **tautology** (logically equivalent to \( \textit{true} \)).

**Step 4: Refined Natural Language Phrasing**  
> *"The system satisfies one of the following:*  
> - *No occurrence of \( i \): At all future times, \( i \) is false.*  
> - *Minimal occurrence of \( i \): \( i \) eventually holds at least once.*  
>   
> *The variable \( f \) imposes no practical constraint due to vacuous satisfaction of the 'until' pattern triggered by \( i \)'s occurrence. Since these cases cover all possible system behaviors, this formula is a tautology and does not impose real-world restrictions on \( i \) or \( f \)."*

**Finalized Translation**:  
\[
\boxed{
\begin{array}{c}
\text{The system either} \\
\quad \bullet ~\text{\textbf{never} enters state } i \textbf{ at any point}, \\
\text{or} \\
\quad \bullet ~\text{enters state } i \textbf{ eventually} \\
\text{(with the "until" clause } f~\mathcal{U}~i \\
\text{satisfied \textit{vacuously} by the occurrence of } i). \\
\\
\text{This formula is a \textbf{tautology} and imposes} \\
\text{no real constraints on the behavior of } i \text{ or } f. \\
\end{array}
}
