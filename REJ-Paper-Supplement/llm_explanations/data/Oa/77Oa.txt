**Step 1 – The original LTL formula**  

\[
\boxed{a \; \mathsf{U}\; \lnot a}
\]

The “U” is the **until** operator.  

---

## Step 2 – Build a parsing tree

```
          U
         / \
        a   ¬a
             |
             a
```

* Root: **U** (until)  
* Left child: **a** – a propositional variable that can be true or false at a given instant.  
* Right child: **¬a** – a negation applied to **a**.

The sub‑formula beneath the right child is again **a**, which we immediately negate to get **¬a**.

---

## Step 3 – Rebuild meaning from the bottom up  

1. **¬a**  
   *Literal meaning:* “\(a\) is *not* true” → “\(a\) is false.”  

2. **a**  
   *Literal meaning:* “\(a\) is true.”  

3. **a  U  ¬a**  
   *Until*(\(\varphi,\,\psi\)) is true at a particular moment \(i\) in a trace iff  
   - there exists a future position \(j \ge i\) where \(\psi\) holds,
   - and \(\varphi\) holds at every position from \(i\) up to but *not including* \(j\).

   Substituting  
   - \(\varphi = a\),
   - \(\psi = \lnot a\),

   gives the following informal description:

   *“\(a\) continues to be true at every instant, until at some later instant (possibly the very next one) it becomes false.”*  
   The instant where \(\lnot a\) first holds is the “switch‑point”; before that point, \(a\) must not be false, and after that point no requirement on \(a\) remains.

---

## Step 4 – Refine the natural‑language phrasing  

1. **Short, direct translation**  
   > “\(a\) holds continuously until it becomes false, and it must eventually become false.”

2. **Expanded explanation**  
   * “If \(a\) is true now, the system must keep \(a\) true forever **until** at some future time the property \(a\) stops being true (i.e., becomes false).  
   * “If, at the very instant you are considering, \(a\) is already false, then the formula is satisfied immediately; you do not have to keep any other condition on \(a\) before that instant.”  
   * “Conversely, if \(a\) never becomes false (the system perpetually keeps \(a\) true), the formula is violated, because the until‑operator requires the right‑hand proposition \(\lnot a\) to hold at least once.”

3. **Final refined natural‑language summary**  

> *“The system guarantees that, while \(a\) remains true, it will not let \(a\) turn false. Finally, at some point the system must turn \(a\) off; after that point, no further obligation on \(a\) exists.”*

### When is the formula satisfied?

| Current state | Satisfaction note |
|---------------|--------------------|
| \(a\) true, <br> eventually \(a\) becomes false | **Satisfied** – the until requirement is fulfilled. |
| \(a\) false (i.e., \(\lnot a\) holds now) | **Satisfied** – the condition \(\lnot a\) holds immediately; the left part is vacuously satisfied. |
| \(a\) true forever (never false) | **Not satisfied** – the right side never holds, violating the until requirement. |

The formula imposes a *temporal guard* on \(a\): you can begin by holding \(a\) true, but you must ultimately switch it off. After you switch it off, you’re free to let \(a\) do whatever you want.
