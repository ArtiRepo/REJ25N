**1. Original LTL formula**  
\[
\mathbf{X}\,(f \land i)
\]

Here  
- `X` = “next” (the property must hold in the successor state),  
- `f` and `i` are atomic propositions (they can be true or false in a state),  
- `∧` = conjunction (“and”).

**2. Parsing tree (breakdown)**  

```
          X
          |
   ┌──────┴───────┐
   |              |
   ∧              (conjunction)
  / \              
 f   i             
```

Explanation of the tree:
- The root node is the temporal operator `X`.  
- Its single child is the Boolean formula `f ∧ i`.  
- That child’s two children are the atomic propositions `f` and `i`.

**3. Bottom‑up reconstruction of meaning**

1. **Atomic propositions**  
   - `f` means “feature f is true in the current state.”  
   - `i` means “indicator i is true in the current state.”

2. **Conjunction (`∧`)**  
   - `f ∧ i` means “both f and i are true in the current state.”

3. **Next operator (`X`)**  
   - `X φ` stipulates that the sub‑formula `φ` must hold *in the next state* (i.e., one transition ahead of the current state).

Putting these together:  
```
X (f ∧ i)
```
means: “In the very next state following the current one, f is true **and** i is true.”

**4. Refined natural‑language phrasing**

> **At the next decision point (or time step) after the current situation, the system must exhibit both conditions `f` and `i` simultaneously.**  
> If, in any run, either `f` or `i` is false in that immediate successor state, the formula is violated for that run; otherwise it is satisfied.

**When the formula is satisfied:**  
- All traces where every state has a successor state that satisfies both `f` and `i`.

**Constraints imposed on the system over time:**  
- The system is forced to maintain `f` and `i` together in the *immediate next step* at every point in time; there is no allowance for a delay or for one of them to be true only in later steps.  
- It does **not** require that `f` and `i` hold forever, only that the immediate successor state meets both conditions.

Thus, `X (f ∧ i)` is a simple one‑step future obligation: *“next time, do `f` and `i` together.”*
