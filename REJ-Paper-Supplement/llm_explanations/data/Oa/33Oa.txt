**Original LTL formula**

\[
(b \; U\; c) \;\wedge\; (d \; U\; \neg b)
\]

### 1.  Parsing tree (syntactic breakdown)

```
                ∧
               / \
              /   \
             /     \
            /       \
          (U)        (U)
           |          |
        ───────   ───────
       |      |   |      |
       b      c   d      ¬b
```

*Root*: conjunction `∧`.  
*Left child*: the until sub‑formula `(b U c)`.  
*Right child*: the until sub‑formula `(d U ¬b)`.

The sub‑formulas are atomic untils that combine an **l‑hand** (the thing that must hold *until*) with an **r‑hand** (the thing that eventually holds).

### 2.  Rebuilding meaning bottom‑up

#### (b U c)  
- **Semantics of `U`**:  
  - There exists a future position \(k\) such that **c** is true at \(k\).  
  - For every position \(i < k\), **b** is true.  
  - In other words, **c** eventually occurs, and *right up to that moment* (but not including it) the system must keep **b** true.

#### (d U ¬b)  
- **Semantics of `U` with `¬b`**:  
  - There exists a future position \(k'\) such that **¬b** holds at \(k'\) (i.e., **b** becomes false).  
  - For every position \(i < k'\), **d** is true.  
  - Thus, *somewhere* the system will lose **b**, and before that point it must have continuously maintained **d**.

#### Conjunction `∧`  
Both of the above requirements have to hold *together* on the same computation.  
So an execution satisfies the whole formula iff:

1. **c** happens at least once, and before that moment **b** stays true for all steps; **and**
2. **b** eventually becomes false at some moment, and before that moment **d** stays true for all steps.

The two occurrences (of **c** and of the “b becomes false”) can be at the same time or at different times; the formula does not order them relative to one another.

### 3.  Refined natural‑language translation

> “Along any execution of the system:  
>  – there must come a moment where property **c** becomes true, and from the very start of the execution up to (but not including) that moment the system must keep property **b** true.  
>  – there must also come a moment where property **b** becomes false, and until that moment the system must maintain property **d** continuously.  
>  Both of these patterns must occur; their relative ordering is irrelevant unless the system’s behaviour forces it.”

In plain terms, the system is required to **keep `b` true until `c` happens** and **keep `d` true until `b` turns false**—simultaneously, it must satisfy both of these “until” constraints in its infinite future.
