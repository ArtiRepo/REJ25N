**Step 1 – Original LTL formula**

```
X ( t ∧ y )
```

---

**Step 2 – Parsing tree (syntactic breakdown)**  

```
          X
          |
      (t ∧ y)
      /     \
     t       y
```

* `X` – the *next* temporal operator  
* `∧` – logical conjunction  
* `t`, `y` – atomic propositions (basic facts about the system)

---

**Step 3 – Bottom‑up reconstruction of meaning**

| Tree node | What it says |
|-----------|--------------|
| `t` | “in the current state, proposition *t* is true.” |
| `y` | “in the current state, proposition *y* is true.” |
| `t ∧ y` | “both *t* and *y* are true in the current state.” |
| `X (t ∧ y)` | “in the *next* state (i.e., the immediate successor of the current state), the proposition *t ∧ y* holds.” |

So, step by step:

1. **Atomic level** – `t` is true in some state, and `y` is true in that same state.
2. **Conjunction** – therefore, in that state *both* statements hold simultaneously.
3. **Next operator** – we shift our attention to the *next* state in the execution trace. In that next state, the conjunction `t ∧ y` must hold.

**Step 4 – Refined natural‑language phrasing**

> **“In the instant immediately following the present moment, the system will be in a state where both `t` and `y` hold true."**

Or, equivalently:

> **“At the next time step, both `t` and `y` are true.”**

### What this formula *constrains* the system

* **Temporal scope:** only the immediate successor of the current state is specified; the current state itself is unconstrained by this formula (unless other constraints require it so).
* **State requirement:** the system must plan (or verify) that after the next transition, the proposition `t` and the proposition `y` are simultaneously satisfied.
* **No further guarantees:** there is no obligation about what happens *after* the next state (e.g., in the state two steps ahead). For that, one would need additional temporal operators (like “G” or “U”).

This completes the step‑by‑step translation of `X (t ∧ y)` from formal syntax to clear, natural‑language understanding.
