**Original LTL formula**

```
(d U c) | (a U !c)
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1.  Parse‑tree (syntactic breakdown)

```
                     OR  (|)
                   /       \
           Until (U)          Until (U)
          /      \          /       \
        d        c        a         !c
```

* `OR` is the largest operator (binary connective \(|\)).
* Each child of the OR is an **Until** sub‑formula.
* The sub‑ultras contain only atomic propositions (`d`, `c`, `a`) or a negated one (`!c`).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2.  Bottom‑up semantic reconstruction

#### 2.1  Atomic propositions  
- `d` – proposition *d* is true in the current state.  
- `c` – proposition *c* is true in the current state.  
- `a` – proposition *a* is true in the current state.  
- `!c` – proposition *c* is **false** in the current state.

#### 2.2  Until operator  
For any two formulas ϕ  and  ψ  the meaning of ϕ U ψ  is:

> “there exists a future time step *t* such that ψ holds at *t*,  
>  and for **every** time step *s* that precedes *t* (including the current step), ϕ holds.”

Applying that to the two sub‑formulas:

| Sub‑formula | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| `d U c` | “Soon, **c** will become true, and until that moment **d** must be true at every step.” |
| `a U !c` | “Soon, **c** will become false (i.e., !c is true), and until that moment **a** must be true at every step.” |

#### 2.3  OR operator  
`φ | ψ` is true **iff** at least one of `φ` or `ψ` is true.  
Therefore the whole formula is true if **either** of the two until‑conditions holds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.  Refined natural‑language description

> **Specification**:  
> “From the current state it is required that **either**  
>  1. the proposition *c* will eventually become true, while *d* remains true on every step that precedes that moment, **or**  
>  2. the proposition *c* will eventually become false, while *a* remains true on every step that precedes that moment.  
>  The specification is satisfied as soon as one of these two patterns is observed; the other pattern is irrelevant.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Why this is the meaning

* The `Until` clauses demand a **continuous stretch** of one proposition (`d` or `a`) that is maintained **up to** the first occurrence of a particular event (`c` becoming true or `c` becoming false).
* The `OR` clause means the system has two **alternative** ways to satisfy the requirement.  
  *If the first alternative is fulfilled, the entire formula is satisfied immediately, even if the second never happens.*  
  *If the second is fulfilled, the formula is satisfied even if the first never happens.*

--------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.  When are the constraints imposed / when is the formula satisfied?

| Situation | Satisfaction | Constraint imposed |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------|
| **At start**: `c` already true and `d` true | **Satisfied** by `d U c` (since the “until” can be satisfied with the current step if `ψ` holds immediately). | No other constraint beyond the current values. |
| **c` becomes true after a run of d`s** | **Satisfied** (by the first until). | The system must *not* let `d` become false before `c` turns true. |
| **c` becomes false after a run of a`s** | **Satisfied** (by the second until). | The system must *not* let `a` become false before `c` turns false. |
| **c` stays true forever, no d** | **Not satisfied** unless `a U !c` holds (i.e., `!c` never occurs). | The formula imposes that either `d` stays true until `c` satifies, or `a` stays true until `c` becomes false. |
| **c` stays false forever, no a** | **Not satisfied** unless `d U c` holds. | Likewise, either `d` must be true until eventual `c`, or `a` must be true until eventual `!c`. |

Thus the LTL formula enforces a predictable pattern: **the system must keep either `d` or `a` continuously true until an appropriate state of `c` (true or false) is reached.** If neither pattern is ever completed, the specification never holds.
