**Original LTL formula**

\[
\mathbf{G}\; (\, j \; \Rightarrow\; \neg f \,)
\]

### 1. Parsing tree (syntactic breakdown)

```
          G
          |
         =>
        / \
       j   ¬f
```

* **Root** – `G` (globally / always)  
* **Immediate sub‑formula** – implication `=>`  
  * Left child – atomic proposition `j`  
  * Right child – negation `¬` applied to the atomic proposition `f`

(If we wish, we could further rewrite the implication as  
`G( ¬j ∨ ¬f )`, but the tree above shows the most transparent structure.)

### 2. Bottom‑up semantic reconstruction

1. **Atomic propositions**  
   * `j` means “the property `j` holds at this instant.”  
   * `f` means “the property `f` holds at this instant.”  
   * `¬f` therefore means “`f` does **not** hold at this instant.”

2. **Implication** (`j => ¬f`)  
   * An implication is true unless the antecedent (`j`) is true **and** the consequent (`¬f`) is false.  
   * Thus, `j => ¬f` is violated *only* when at the same instant `j` is true **and** `f` is true.

3. **Globally (G)**  
   * `G φ` means “`φ` holds at every instant along the entire infinite execution.”  
   * Hence, `G (j => ¬f)` asserts that *for every time step* in *every* run, the implication must hold.

Combining all three:  
**At every instant of every run, if `j` is true, then `f` must be false.** Equivalently, “`j` and `f` may never be true together at the same time.”

### 3. Refined natural‑language phrasing

> **No moment may witness both `j` and `f` simultaneously.**  
>  
> In other words, *whenever* the system shows the property `j`, it must not at that same moment exhibit the property `f`.  
>  
> If either `j` never occurs or `f` never occurs, the property is trivially satisfied.  
>  
> The property is violated as soon as there exists a single time instant where `j` holds **and** `f` holds – a situation the system is forbidden from entering.

**Safety interpretation**  
This is a classic safety requirement: it continually forbids the unsafe combination `j ∧ f`. Once the system lets `j` and `f` co‑occur, the property is permanently violated. Thus, the formula certifies that *`j` and `f` are mutually exclusive over all time.*
