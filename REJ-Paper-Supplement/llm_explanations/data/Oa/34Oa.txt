**Original LTL formula**

```
G (!f | !i)
```

### 1. Parsing tree (bottom‑up breakdown)

```
           G
           |
          OR
         /   \
       !f     !i
       |      |
       f      i
```

- **Top level**: `G` (Globally / “always”)
- **Next level**: `|` (Logical OR)
- **Operands of the OR**: two negations, `!f` and `!i`
- **Leaves**: atomic propositions `f` and `i`

### 2. Rebuilding the meaning from the bottom

1. **`!f`**  
   *Interpretation*: At the current instant, the proposition `f` is **false**.

2. **`!i`**  
   *Interpretation*: At the current instant, the proposition `i` is **false**.

3. **`!f | !i`**  
   *Interpretation*: At the current instant, **at least one** of the two conditions holds – either `f` is false, or `i` is false, or both are false.  
   *Equivalently*: “It is not the case that both `f` and `i` are true at the same time.”

4. **`G (!f | !i)`**  
   *Interpretation*: The above property (`!f | !i`) must be true **at every point in time**.  
   *In plain terms*: **At every instant, at least one of `f` or `i` must be false** – you can never find a moment where both are true together.

### 3. Refined natural‑language phrasing

- **“It is always the case that either `f` is false or `i` is false.”**  
  This emphasizes the universal (global) aspect: the rule applies all the time.

- **“`f` and `i` are never simultaneously true.”**  
  This is the contrapositive, often more intuitive for specifying constraints that forbid a particular combination.

- **“Whenever the system runs, you will never observe both `f` and `i` being true at the same time; at least one of them must be false at every instant.”**  
  Adds a bit of context about the operating timeline.

All three sentences capture the same semantic content of the formula; choose whichever best fits the audience or system documentation style.
