**LTL Formula**  
\[
\textbf{a}
\]

---

### 1. Parsing tree  

```
            a            (atomic proposition)
```

- The entire formula is a single leaf node: the proposition **a**.  
- No logical or temporal operators surround it.

---

### 2. Bottom‑up reconstruction of meaning  

1. **Atomic level** – An atomic proposition `a` is true in a state if the system’s current valuation assigns `true` to `a`.  
2. **No operators** – Because there are no logical (`¬, ∧, ∨, →`) or temporal (`◯, U, F, G, X`) operators, the truth of the formula depends only on the current state and nothing else.  

Thus the satisfaction relation is simply:  
\(M, s_i, i \models a \iff a\ \text{holds in state}\ s_i\).

---

### 3. Refined natural‑language phrasing  

- **“The property `a` holds right now.”**  
- **“At this moment the system is in a state where `a` is true.”**  
- **“`a` must currently be true; there is no requirement about the future or past.”**

The formula places no constraints beyond the present: it is fulfilled whenever the current state satisfies `a`, and it fails if `a` is false in that state. No additional events or time intervals are referenced.
