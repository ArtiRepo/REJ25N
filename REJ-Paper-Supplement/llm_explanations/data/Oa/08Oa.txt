**Original LTL formula**

```
b U !d
```

## 1.  Parsing tree – how the formula is built

```
            U
          /   \
       b        !
                 |
                 d
```

* **`b`** – atomic proposition (“the system satisfies property b”).
* **`d`** – atomic proposition (“the system satisfies property d”).
* **`!`** – unary operator “not”; `!d` is true exactly when **d** is false.
* **`U`** – binary temporal operator “until”; `b U !d` uses **b** as the
  left sub‑formula and `!d` as the right sub‑formula.

---

## 2.  Semantic reconstruction – bottom‑up

1. **Leaf level**  
   * `b` : “property b holds in the current state.”  
   * `d` : “property d holds in the current state.”  

2. **Unary operator**  
   * `!d` : “property d does **not** hold in the current state”  
     (i.e., “the system is **not** in a state where d is true”).

3. **Binary `until`** `b U !d`  
   * Standard semantics of LTL’s `Until` (until‑operator):  
     * There exists some future time instant \(k \ge 0\) such that  
       `!d` holds at time \(k\).  
     * For every time instant \(j\) with \(0 \le j < k\), `b` holds at time \(j\).  
     * Nothing is required about states after \(k\); the property is satisfied as soon as the right‑hand side becomes true.

   * In words: **“b must be true on every step up to, but not including,
     the first step where d becomes false; once d is false the requirement
     stops.”**

## 3.  Refined natural‑language description

- **Informal translation**  
  > “From now on, **b** has to hold continuously until **d** becomes false. There must be a moment in the future at which **d** is false, and until that moment all steps satisfy **b**. If **d** never becomes false, the property is not satisfied.”

- **Key points to highlight**  
  1. **Immediate satisfaction** – If the system starts in a state where **d** is already false, `b U !d` is satisfied immediately (no `b` required at all).  
  2. **Pre‑condition for `b`** – While `!d` hasn’t occurred yet, the system is *forced* to keep `b` true at every step.  
  3. **No post‑constraint** – After the first `!d` event, the formula places no further requirements on the system.

- **Example phrasing**  
  *“Maintain property b at every step until property d ceases to hold; once d stops holding the requirement is fulfilled.”*

This completes the translation of `b U !d` from its formal LTL syntax to a clear natural‑language understanding, explaining both when the formula is satisfied and what constraints it imposes over time.
