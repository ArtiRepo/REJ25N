          t
```

* **`!`** – the logical NOT (negation) operator  
* **`X`** – the “next” temporal operator  
* **`t`** – an atomic proposition (a Boolean variable that can be true or false at each step)

### 2. Bottom‑up semantics

1. **`t`**  
   - At any given step, `t` is simply an assertion about whether the proposition `t` holds (is true) in that step.

2. **`X t`**  
   - “In the *next* step, `t` is true.”  
   - Formally, `X t` holds in the current state iff `t` is true in the immediately following state.

3. **`!X t`**  
   - Negate the above: “It is *not* the case that `t` will be true in the next step.”  
   - Equivalently: “In the next state, `t` must be false.”

### 3. Refined natural‑language interpretation

- **Primary meaning**  
  - *At the current point in the execution, the proposition `t` must not hold one step later.*  
  - If the system happens to have `t` true immediately after the current snapshot, the formula `!X t` is violated.

- **Behaviour over a run**  
  - This constraint applies only to the single immediate successor of the current state.  
  - Beyond that successor, no further requirement is imposed by `!X t`; subsequent states may satisfy `t` or not—`!X t` does not speak about them.

- **When the formula is satisfied versus violated**  
  - **Satisfied**: In the state after the current one, `t` evaluates to **false**.  
  - **Violated**: In that immediate successor state, `t` evaluates to **true**.

### 4. Summary in plain English

> **“The next state must not have the proposition `t` true.”**

This formulation places a one‑step restriction: at every moment where the formula is evaluated, we require that the very next step does **not** satisfy `t`. Any execution that has `t` true in the immediate next state will not satisfy the formula; any execution where `t` is false in that next state does satisfy it (and the formula says nothing else about the future).
