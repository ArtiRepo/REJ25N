### 1.  Parsing tree (bottom‑up)

```
                                   ┌───────────────┐
                                   │   Conjunction │
                           ┌───────┤   (∧)         ├───────┐
                           │       └───────────────┘       │
                           │                                │
                ┌───────────┐                      ┌───────────────┐
                │   F a     │                      │   F b         │
                │   (Event.)│                      │   (Event.)    │
                └───────────┘                      └───────────────┘
                         │                                  │
                       a (atomic proposition)        b (atomic proposition)
```

* **Leaf nodes** – `a` and `b` are atomic propositions; they are simply “the condition `a` holds” or “the condition `b` holds” in a given state.
* **Next level** – `F a` means “eventually `a` will be true”, i.e. there must be some future time point (≥0 steps ahead) where `a` holds.  
  Similarly, `F b` means “eventually `b` will be true”.
* **Root node** – the conjunction `F a ∧ F b` requires that **both** sub‑formulas be true simultaneously, i.e. the system should eventually see `a` and eventually see `b`.

---

### 2.  Bottom‑up meaning reconstruction

1. **Atomic propositions**  
   * `a` : “The property `a` holds in the current state.”  
   * `b` : “The property `b` holds in the current state.”

2. **Temporal operators**  
   * `F a` : “At some point in the future (possibly the current state), `a` will be true.”  
   * `F b` : “At some point in the future (possibly the current state), `b` will be true.”

3. **Conjunction**  
   * `F a ∧ F b` : “Both `a` will eventually hold **and** `b` will eventually hold.”  
   * The two eventualities do **not** need to happen at the same time; they can occur in any order, possibly overlapping, and perhaps even in the same state.

---

### 3.  Refined natural‑language phrasing

> **“The system will at some point in the future exhibit property `a`, and it will at some (possibly different) future point exhibit property `b`.  
> In particular, both `a` and `b` must occur at least once along the run, but there is no constraint on when they happen relative to each other or whether they hold simultaneously.”**

---

### 4.  Constraints on the system

* The system **cannot** remain forever in a state where neither `a` nor `b` ever holds; at least one future state must satisfy each of them.
* The order of appearance is irrelevant, so the system could:
  * first satisfy `a`, then `b`;
  * first satisfy `b`, then `a`;
  * satisfy both at the same state (both `a` and `b` true simultaneously);
  * or alternate arbitrarily, as long as each shows up at least once eventually.

Thus, `F a ∧ F b` is a simple **dual‑eventuality** requirement: ensure *both* a and b will happen at some point along the execution.
