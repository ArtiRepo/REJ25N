**Original LTL formula**  
```
G a
```

## 1. Breaking the formula into a parsing tree  

The grammar of Linear‑Temporal Logic (LTL) allows us to decompose the formula into its logical operators and atomic propositions.  
For `G a` we have only one operator and one atomic proposition:

```
       G
        |
        a
```

* `G` – the *globally* (or *always*) temporal operator.  
* `a` – an atomic proposition (a Boolean variable that may be true or false in a state).

Thus the tree consists of a single edge from the `G` node up to the atomic `a`.

## 2. Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up  

**Bottom (atomic proposition `a`):**  
- In any state, `a` is *true* iff the property described by `a` holds in that state.  
- The truth of `a` is evaluated point‑wise: at every instant of a run we check whether `a` is true.

**Next level (`G a`):**  
- `G` (“globally/always”) quantifies over all future time steps.  
- `G a` is true at a particular state *iff* the sub‑formula `a` is true *at every state* from that point onward (including the present state).  
- In temporal‑logic semantics:  
  ```
  (σ, i) ⊨ G a   ⇔   ∀j ≥ i, (σ, j) ⊨ a
  ```
  where `σ` is a trace (an infinite sequence of states) and `i` is the current time index.

So, starting from the bottom, we conclude: **“`a` must hold at all times”**.

## 3. Refining the natural‑language phrasing  

### Basic translation  
> **“Always `a`.”**  
> The property `a` must be true at every point in time along any execution of the system.

### More verbose form  
> **“From this point onward, the system must satisfy proposition `a` at every instant; if at any time `a` becomes false, the specification is violated.”**

### Common interpretations  
* **Safety property** – `G a` forbids any state where `a` is false; it guarantees that the system never leaves the set of states where `a` holds.  
* **No eventuality** – unlike `F a` (“eventually `a`”), `G a` does **not** merely require that `a` become true at some future point; it requires that `a` be true **continuously**.

### Example in context  
Suppose `a` means “the safety latch is closed”.  
Then `G a` mandates that the latch must remain closed throughout the entire operation of the system: every moment of the execution must see the latch closed.

---

In summary, the LTL formula `G a` specifies a **global** (always) requirement: the atomic proposition `a` must hold at every instant along any possible execution of the system. When such a condition is violated at any time, the LTL formula evaluates to false for that execution.
