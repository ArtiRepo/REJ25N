**Original LTL formula**

```
a U G!a
```

## 1.  Parsing tree (sub‑formula breakdown)

```
                            U
                          /   \
                         a     G!a
                              / \
                             G   !a
                                |
                                a
```

* `a` – atomic proposition  
* `!a` – logical negation of `a`  
* `G!a` – “always `!a`” (i.e., `!a` holds in every future state from the moment it becomes true)  
* `a U G!a` – the “until” operator: the left side (`a`) must hold up to (but not necessarily during) the first moment that the right side (`G!a`) becomes true.

## 2.  Building the meaning bottom‑up

1. **`!a`**  
   *Meaning*: “`a` is false.”

2. **`G!a`**  
   *Meaning*: “from a certain time onward, `a` is permanently false.”  
   - (`a` never becomes true again from that point.)

3. **`a U G!a`**  
   *Basic LTL semantics*:
   - `G!a` must eventually hold at some future state *t*.
   - While we are **before** state *t*, every state must satisfy `a`.
   - At state *t*, `G!a` becomes true, which means `!a` is true there and thereafter.

   *Put simply*:  
   “`a` holds continuously until a point after which `a` never holds again.”

## 3.  Refining the natural‑language description

**Concrete wording**

> *The system starts with `a` being true, and it remains true through all steps until a first moment — after which `a` stays false forever (including that moment).*

In other words:

* At every state before a certain time the proposition `a` must be true.  
* At the first state where the system switches to a permanently “`a`‑is‑false” mode (encoded by `G!a`), `a` becomes false and never becomes true again.

---

## 4.  When is the formula satisfied?  

*There must exist a finite index *t* such that:*
1. **For all indices *k* < *t***, `a` holds at step *k*.  
2. **At index *t***, `a` is false (`!a` holds).  
3. **From index *t* onward**, `a` never holds again (the `G!a` part is satisfied for every subsequent step).

If no such time *t* exists (e.g., `a` stays true forever), the formula is **not** satisfied.

---

## 5.  Constraints imposed on the system

1. **Continuity of `a` before a change** – the system cannot let `a` become false before the obligatory transition point.
2. **Eventual permanent silence of `a`** – the system must, at some finite future time, switch `a` to a forever‑false mode and keep it there.

Thus the LTL formula is a safety‑liveness combination:

* *Safety*: `a` cannot be violated until the moment where `a` permanently stops.
* *Liveness*: The switch to permanent “`a`‑is‑false” must eventually happen.
