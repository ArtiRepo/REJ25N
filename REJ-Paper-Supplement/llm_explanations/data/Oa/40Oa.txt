**Original LTL formula**

```
F ( o | u )
```

---

### 1. Build a parsing (syntax) tree  

The formula is parsed according to the LTL grammar.  
* **Root** – the temporal operator `F` (future / “eventually”).
* **Child of root** – the Boolean sub‑formula `( o | u )`.
  * **Left operand** – the atomic proposition `o`.
  * **Right operand** – the atomic proposition `u`.
  * **Operator between them** – `|` (logical disjunction, i.e. “or”).

```
          F
          |
       (o | u)
        /   \
       o     u
```

---

### 2. Bottom‑up reconstruction of meaning  

1. **Atomic propositions `o` and `u`**  
   * Each of these is a *state property*: at a particular instant of the system’s execution, the property can be either true or false.  
   * `o` means “the system is in a state where property o holds.”  
   * `u` means “the system is in a state where property u holds.”

2. **Disjunction `(o | u)`**  
   * This is true in a given state if **either** `o` is true **or** `u` is true (or both).  
   * It represents the situation “the system exhibits property o *or* property u (possibly both).”

3. **Temporal operator `F`**  
   * `F φ` (“eventually φ”) is true along a trace if there is **some point in the future (including the present)** at which `φ` holds.  
   * Otherwise, if `φ` never holds on the trace, `F φ` is false.

4. **Combining the layers**  
   * `F (o | u)` therefore says:  
     *“There is some future time (possibly now) where the system’s state satisfies the disjunction `o ∨ u`.  
     In other words, at some point, **either** property o will hold **or** property u will hold (the two may both hold at that same time).”*

### 3. Natural‑language refinement

**High‑level description**

> **Eventually, the system will exhibit either property o or property u.**

**Explicit interpretation**

* *Satisfaction*: The formula is satisfied on a run if **there exists at least one time step** (including the starting state) where **`o` is true or `u` is true**.  
* *Constraint*: The formula imposes no requirement about how long the system must wait; it merely forbids the possibility that **neither** `o` nor `u` ever become true on any infinite execution. The system is free to return to states where both properties are false until eventually one of them becomes true.

**Edge cases to be aware of**

| Situation | Does `F (o | u)` hold? | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------------------|-------------|
| `o` true at time 0 | Yes | `F` is satisfied immediately. |
| `u` true at time 5, `o` never true | Yes | The disjunction becomes true at time 5. |
| `o` and `u` never become true | No | The disjunction never becomes true, so `F` never holds. |
| Both `o` and `u` become true at the same time | Yes | The disjunction is true (inclusive “or”). |

If the operator `|` were interpreted as exclusive or (XOR) instead of inclusive or—a notation that is sometimes used informally—it would read “eventually, exactly one of `o` or `u` holds at some time.” The standard LTL semantics, however, treat `|` as the *inclusive* logical OR.

**Final natural‑language translation**

> The property `F (o | u)` asserts that *at some moment in the future (possibly immediately), the system will be in a state where either property o is true or property u is true (or both)*.  
> It is satisfied as soon as `o` or `u` occurs and is only violated if both propositions stay false forever.
