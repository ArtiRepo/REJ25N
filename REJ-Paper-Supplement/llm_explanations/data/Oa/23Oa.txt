**Original LTL Formula**  

\[
t \;\Rightarrow\; w
\]

### 1. Parsing tree (breakdown)

```
          (→)
         /   \
        t     w
```

- The root node is the implication operator “→”.
- The left sub‑branch is the atomic proposition **t**.
- The right sub‑branch is the atomic proposition **w**.

---

### 2. Reconstruct the meaning from the bottom up

1. **Atomic propositions**  
   - **t**: some Boolean property that can hold (true) or not (false) at any given instant.  
   - **w**: another Boolean property, likewise evaluated at each instant.

2. **Implication**  
   LTL evaluates formulas at every *time step* (state).  
   The semantics of the implication “A → B” at a particular time step *k* is:  
   \[
   A_k \;\Rightarrow\; B_k \;\;\text{is true iff either}\;\; A_k \text{ is false or } B_k \text{ is true.}
   \]

3. **Combining**  
   For every time step *k* in the infinite run of the system:
   - If **t** is true at *k*, then **w** must also be true at *k*.  
   - If **t** is false at *k*, the implication imposes no requirement on **w** at that time.

Hence the formula restricts the system only in the situations where **t** becomes true; it forbids any state where **t** holds but **w** does **not**.

### 3. Refined natural‑language phrasing

> **"Whenever `t` holds, `w` must also hold at the same instant."**

Or equivalently:

> **"The system cannot be in a state where `t` is true while `w` is false."**

This single clause is the entire specification: all other combinations of truth values (`t` false, `w` true; or both false) are allowed. The implication imposes a *concurrency‑style* constraint that applies instantaneously at every point in time.
