**Original LTL formula**

```
G !a
```

### 1.  Parsing tree (bottom‑up)

```
        G
        |
       !a
        |
        a
```

* **`a`** – an atomic proposition (whatever “\(a\)” stands for in your system).  
* **`!a`** – the negation of that proposition: “\(a\) does *not* hold in this state”.  
* **`G !a`** – the global (always) operator applied to `!a`: “in every state along the run, `!a` holds”.

---

### 2.  Meaning rebuilt from the bottom

1. **`a`**  
   *Interpreted as:* “the property \(a\) is true in the current instant”.

2. **`!a`**  
   *Interpreted as:* “the property \(a\) is false in the current instant”.  
   (It says “\(a\) does not happen right now”.)

3. **`G !a`**  
   *Interpreted as:* “for every position of the execution (including the present and all future moments), the statement `!a` holds”.  
   Equivalently: “\(a\) is *never* true at any point along the trace”.

Thus **bottom‑up translation**:  
- *`a` → “\(a\) holds”*  
- *`!a` → “\(a\) does not hold”*  
- *`G !a` → “at every moment, \(a\) does not hold”*.

### 3.  Refined natural‑language phrasing

> **“The system must never exhibit property \(a\) at any time.”**  
>  
> In other words, from the very first instant onward, the atomic proposition `a` must be false forever.  
>  
> **What this imposes:**  
> * If the event/truth represented by `a` ever becomes true—even once in the future—then `G !a` is violated and the specification is not satisfied.  
> * The property is a *safety constraint*: the system is required to avoid `a` entirely for the entire duration of its execution (including the present state).

### 4.  When the formula is satisfied / violated

* **Satisfied** – when on every state of the trace the proposition `a` is false.  
  (The trace looks like: `(!a, !a, !a, …)`.)

* **Violated** – when there exists any state in the trace where `a` is true.  
  (Even a single `a` at any future point breaks the guarantee.)

---

**Summary:**  
`G !a` is a “never a” requirement – the system must keep the property `a` forever false. It is a straightforward safety constraint that imposes a global prohibition on the occurrence of `a` throughout the entire execution.
