### 1.  Parsing tree (syntactic breakdown)

```
                     AND
                ______|______
               |           |
           F a            G
                       |
                   (a -> X G ¬a)
                    /      |      \
                   a      ->      X
                            |       G
                            |      |
                           a   (¬a)
```

* **Atomic propositions**  
  - `a`  
  - `¬a` (negation of `a`)

* **Temporal operators**  
  - `F a` – “finally a” (eventually a becomes true)  
  - `X G ¬a` – “in the next state, from then on a is always false”  
  - `G (a → X G ¬a)` – “globally (always), if a holds now, then the next state must satisfy `G ¬a`”

### 2.  Bottom‑up reconstruction of meaning

1. **`¬a`** – a state where the proposition `a` is false.  

2. **`G ¬a`** – “always not a”, i.e., “from the current point forward, a never becomes true.”  

3. **`X G ¬a`** – “next, always not a”.  
   *Interpretation*: At the very next time step, starting from there on, `a` will never hold again.

4. **`a → X G ¬a`** – “if `a` holds now, then (in the next step) `a` will never hold again.”  
   *Interpretation*: Whenever `a` is true, it must be the last occurrence of `a`.

5. **`G(a → X G ¬a)`** – “always, if `a` holds now, then it will never hold again afterwards.”  
   This enforces that *no* occurrence of `a` can be followed by another occurrence.  
   It allows `a` to hold once (or never), but forbids multiple time‑points where `a` is true.

6. **`F a`** – “eventually `a` holds at least once.”  
   This provides the lower bound: there must be at least one occurrence of `a`.

7. **`F a ∧ G(a → X G ¬a)`** – Combine the two constraints:  
   * There is at least one point in the future where `a` is true.  
   * Once `a` becomes true, it can never become true again.

### 3.  Refined natural‑language phrasing

**“The proposition `a` becomes true at least once, and after that first time it can never become true again.”**

Equivalently:  
*“There is exactly one state in the execution trace where `a` holds.”*

#### Quick sanity check

- If `a` never occurs, `F a` fails → whole formula fails.  
- If `a` occurs once and never again → both conjuncts satisfied.  
- If `a` occurs twice → the second occurrence violates `G(a → X G ¬a)` → whole formula fails.  

So the formula precisely encodes *single‑occurrence* of `a`.
