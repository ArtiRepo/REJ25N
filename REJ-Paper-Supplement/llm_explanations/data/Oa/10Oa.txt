**1. Original LTL formula**

```
(d ∨ ¬b)  U  ¬a
```

---

**2. Parsing tree (breakdown)**  

```
              U
            /   \
          ∨      ¬
        /   \    |
       d     ¬b   a
```

* **Root**: `U` (Until)  
* **Left child**: `∨` (Disjunction) with operands `d` and `¬b`  
* **Right child**: `¬` (Negation) of `a`

**3. Bottom‑up reconstruction of meaning**

| Subformula | Interpretation | Explanation |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| `a` | “the atomic proposition *a* holds” | Basic truth of `a` at the current state. |
| `¬a` | “*a* does **not** hold” | Negation: at the current state the value of `a` is false. |
| `b` | “*b* holds” | Basic truth of `b`. |
| `¬b` | “*b* does **not** hold” | Negation: `b` is false. |
| `d ∨ ¬b` | “either *d* holds, **or** *b* does **not** hold” | Disjunction: at least one of the two sub‑conditions is satisfied in the current state. |
| `(d ∨ ¬b) U ¬a` | “Eventually *¬a* will become true, and until that point the formula `d ∨ ¬b` must hold in every state” | Definition of the **Until** operator: <br>• `¬a` (the right part) must occur at some future state (possibly the very next state or later). <br>• For every state preceding that `¬a` state, the left part (`d ∨ ¬b`) must be true. <br>• If `¬a` is already true in the current state, the whole formula holds vacuously – no requirement on the left part. <br>• If `¬a` never becomes true, the requirement is that `d ∨ ¬b` holds forever. |

**4. Refined natural‑language phrasing**

> **“While the proposition `a` stays true, the system must keep either `d` true or `b` false in every state. This condition can be lifted only when `a` becomes false; once `¬a` holds, the requirement on `d` and `b` ends.”**

Alternative paraphrasing for clarity:

* “Either `d` holds or `b` does not hold at every moment, **as long as `a` is true**. The obligation is satisfied once `a` stops being true.”
* “The condition `d ∨ ¬b` is enforced continuously until the first moment when `a` becomes false; after that moment, the formula imposes no further constraint.”

**Key points for understanding satisfaction**

1. **Immediate satisfaction** – If `¬a` is true in the very first state, the entire formula is satisfied and no further state needs to satisfy `d ∨ ¬b`.
2. **Long‑running requirement** – If `a` remains true forever, the system must keep `d ∨ ¬b` true at every state forever.
3. **Finite waiting** – If `a` becomes false at some finite future step `k`, the system must guarantee `d ∨ ¬b` at every state `0 … k‑1`, and the formula is satisfied at step `k` where `¬a` holds.

That is the complete translation of `(d ∨ ¬b) U ¬a` into plain English, along with the reasoning behind each component.
