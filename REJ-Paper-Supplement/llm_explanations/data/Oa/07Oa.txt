**Original LTL formula**  
\[
a\, U\, c

### 1.  Parsing tree

```
      U
     / \
    a   c
```

- **U** – the *until* operator  
- **a** – atomic proposition  
- **c** – atomic proposition

---

### 2.  Step‑by‑step reconstruction (bottom up)

1. **Atomic propositions**  
   - `a` means “the property **a** holds at the current state.”  
   - `c` means “the property **c** holds at the current state.”

2. **Until (`U`)**  
   The subformula `a U c` is satisfied by a run if and only if:
   - **There exists a future state** (possibly the very next one) where `c` is true.
   - **Until that future state**, every intermediate state satisfies `a`.

   Formally:  
   \[
   \exists k \ge 0 : 
   \big( (c \text{ holds at step } k) \land
   \forall j < k : a \text{ holds at step } j \big)
   \]

   - If `c` is already true at the current state (`k = 0`), the second part (the “for all j < k” clause) is vacuously true: no intermediate states need to satisfy `a`.  
   - If `c` never becomes true, the formula is **unsatisfied** regardless of `a`.

---

### 3.  Natural‑language interpretation (refined)

> **“Property **a** must hold continuously until property **c** becomes true.**  
> When **c** becomes true, the constraint on **a** stops; after that point, the values of **a** are irrelevant to the formula. If **c** never becomes true, the formula is violated.”

---

### 4.  Quick example to illustrate satisfaction

| Time step | a | c | Is `a U c` satisfied? |
|-----------|---|---|-----------------------|
| 0         | T | F | No, `c` hasn't occurred yet |
| 1         | T | F | No |
| 2         | T | T | **Yes** – `a` held at 0,1; `c` true at 2 |

If at step 0 `c` had been true, then `a U c` would already be satisfied (the “until” part would have a zero‑length interval of `a`).

---

### 5.  Summary

- **When satisfied:** there is a *future time* where `c` becomes true, and from now until that time, every state must satisfy `a`.  
- **When it imposes a constraint:** as long as `c` has not yet become true, the system must keep `a` true; failure to do so breaks the formula.  
- **When no constraint:** once `c` occurs, the formula’s obligation is fulfilled and no further requirements on `a` are enforced.
