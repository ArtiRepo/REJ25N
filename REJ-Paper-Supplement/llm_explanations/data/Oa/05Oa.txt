**Original LTL formula**  
```
X a & b
```

### 1. Parsing tree (breakdown)

| Node | Symbol | Children |
|------|--------|----------|
| **1** | `&` (conjunction) | **2** `X a` , **3** `b` |
| **2** | `X` (next) | **4** `a` |
| **3** | predicate | `b` |
| **4** | predicate | `a` |

*Notes:*  
- `X` is a unary operator, so it applies only to `a`.  
- The conjunction `&` has lower precedence than `X`; therefore the formula is parsed as `(X a) & b`, **not** `X (a & b)`.

---

### 2. Rebuilding meaning (bottom‑up)

1. **Leaf predicates**  
   - `a` : “the proposition **a** is true in the considered state.”  
   - `b` : “the proposition **b** is true in the considered state.”

2. **Unary `X` operator** (`X a`)  
   - “in the **next state** (i.e., one transition ahead), the proposition **a** is true.”  
   - In timeline terms: *current → next → future.*

3. **Conjunction** (`(X a) & b`)  
   - Both sub‑expressions must hold simultaneously.  
   - “At the current time step, `b` holds, **and** if you look one step ahead, `a` will hold.”

### 3. Natural‑language phrasing (refined)

> **The system must satisfy two simultaneous conditions:**  
> • **Right now** it must be the case that **`b`** holds.  
> • **In the very next state** (immediately after the current one) the proposition **`a`** must hold.  

If either `b` is false at the present instant or `a` is false in the next instant, the formula is violated. Thus, the formula imposes a *current* constraint on `b` and a *future* constraint on `a`.
