(a\;U\;b)\;\wedge\;(c\;U\;d)

### 1. Parsing tree

```
          AND
         /   \
      UNTIL  UNTIL
      / \    /  \
     a   b  c    d
```

* The left child of the root is the subformula **a U b**.  
* The right child is **c U d**.  
* Each **U** node has two children: the “until” proposition (a or c) and the terminating proposition (b or d).

### 2. Bottom‑up reconstruction of meaning

#### 2.1   The **a U b** subformula  
- **When is it true?**  
  There must be a (possibly immediate) future state where **b** holds.  
  All states from the present (time 0) up to, but not including, that first **b**‑state must satisfy **a**.  
- **What happens after the first b?**  
  The requirement on **a** disappears; after **b** holds we are free to let **a** become false.

#### 2.2   The **c U d** subformula  
- Analogous to above:  
  *There must be a future state where **d** holds.*  
  *Every state up to that point (not including it) must satisfy **c**.*  
  *After the first d the restriction on **c** is lifted.*

#### 2.3   The conjunction  
Both subformulas must be true **simultaneously**.  
Thus:

1. There is a future time \(t_b\) where **b** holds and for all times \(0 \leq t < t_b\), **a** holds.  
2. There is a future time \(t_d\) where **d** holds and for all times \(0 \leq t < t_d\), **c** holds.  

The two “until” intervals can overlap, may be disjoint, and can end in any order; the formula imposes no coordination between them beyond the individual “until” requirements.

### 3. Refined natural‑language phrase

> **“Proposition a must stay true until a proposition b first becomes true, and at the same time proposition c must stay true until a proposition d first becomes true.  
> After each of those terminating propositions has appeared, a no longer has to hold; the same holds for c.”**

A system satisfies the formula when:

* **Both** b **and** d eventually occur.  
* **Until** b occurs, the system must never violate a.  
* **Until** d occurs, the system must never violate c.  
* After b or d occurs, the formula does not place any further requirement on a or c (they may become false).

If either b or d never happens, the formula is violated, because the corresponding “until” condition never finishes. The two until constraints are independent, so the timing of b compared to d is irrelevant.
