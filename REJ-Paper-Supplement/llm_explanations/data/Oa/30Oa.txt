**Original LTL formula**

```
X a ∧ ¬G b
```

### 1.  Parsing tree (syntactic breakdown)

```
            ∧
           / \
          X   ¬
         /     \
        a       G
                |
                b
```

- **Tree root**: conjunction `∧`  
  - **Left child**: `X a`  
    - Operator `X` (“next”) applied to atomic proposition `a`.  
  - **Right child**: `¬ G b`  
    - Negation `¬` applied to `G b`.  
    - Inside the negation, `G` (“globally”) with atomic proposition `b`.

### 2.  Building the meaning from bottom‑up

1. **Base level**  
   - `a` : “the proposition a is true in the current state.”  
   - `b` : “the proposition b is true in the current state.”

2. **Unary operators**  
   - `X a` : “in the *next* state (time step +1), a is true.”  
   - `G b`  : “b is true *in every* state from now on.”  

3. **Negation**  
   - `¬G b` : “it is **not** the case that b holds in all future states.”  
   - Equivalently, `¬G b` ↔ `F ¬b` (“at some future state, b will be false”).

4. **Conjunction**  
   - `X a ∧ ¬G b` : “both conditions hold simultaneously:  
     (i) a is true in the next state, and  
     (ii) at some future point the proposition b becomes false.”

### 3.  Refined natural‑language description

> **In the next instant the system must satisfy the property a.  
> Additionally, it is required that b does **not** hold forever; sooner or later the system must reach a state where b is false.**

Key points for understanding the timing constraints:

- The **“next”** operator pins the truth of a to *exactly* the very next time step.  
- The **negated “globally”** operator forces *eventual* falsity of b (the system cannot keep b true at all times).  
- There is no requirement that b be false in the next step; it can still hold there as long as it fails at least once later.  

This concise natural‑language explanation captures both the instantaneous and the long‑term aspects encoded in the original LTL formula.
