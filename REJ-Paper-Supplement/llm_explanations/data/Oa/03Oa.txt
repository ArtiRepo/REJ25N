**Original LTL formula**  
```
a ∧ X b
```

### 1.  Parsing tree  

```
            ∧
           / \
          a   X
               |
               b
```

* The root operator is **∧** (logical conjunction).  
* Its left child is the atomic proposition **a** (a leaf).  
* Its right child is the temporal operator **X** (next‑time), whose own child is the atomic proposition **b**.

### 2.  Bottom‑up reconstruction of meaning  

1. **Leaf “b”** – “the proposition *b* is true in the state that follows the current one.”  
2. **Operator “X”** applied to b – *X b* means “in the **next** state, b holds.”  
3. **Conjunction** – *a ∧ X b* therefore reads:  
   *“a holds in the current state **and** b holds in the next state.”*

### 3.  Refined natural‑language phrasing

> **At the current instant, the proposition `a` must be true, and at the immediately following instant, the proposition `b` must be true.**  
>  
> In other words, the system’s current configuration must satisfy `a`, while its next configuration must satisfy `b`.  
>  
> **When is it satisfied?**  
> Whenever the system is in a state where `a` holds and transitions to a state where `b` holds.  
>  
> **What does it constrain?**  
> The system must ensure that any transition from a state that satisfies `a` goes to a state that satisfies `b`. If either `a` is false now or `b` is false in the next state, the formula is violated.
