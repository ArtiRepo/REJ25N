**2. Parsing tree (syntactic breakdown)**  

```
            ¬
            |
            G
            |
            c
```

* The root operator is the negation `¬`.  
* Its single child is the temporal operator `G` (“globally / always”).  
* `G` applies to the atomic proposition `c`.

**3. Bottom‑up reconstruction of meaning**

| Bottom subformula | Meaning (step‑by‑step) | Narrative in words |
|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| `c` | “The proposition `c` is true in the current state.” | **c** is true right now. |
| `G c` | “For every moment from now on, `c` is true.” | **c** holds *at all times* from here onward. |
| `¬ G c` | “It is **not** the case that `c` holds at all times.” | **It is not guaranteed that `c` will always be true**; at least once, it must be false. |

Because the outermost operator is a negation, the whole formula is satisfied exactly when `G c` is *not* satisfied.  
If there exists a state in the future where `c` is false, then the inner `G c` fails, making the negation true.  

Equivalently, using the LTL identity `¬ G p  ≡  F ¬p` (not globally p ≡ eventually not p), the formula can be rewritten as:  

\[
F\,\neg c
\]

which reads plainly “**at some future point, `c` will be false**.”

**4. Refined natural‑language translation**

- **Original LTL**: `¬ G c`  
- **Natural‑language phrasing**:  
  “It is **not** the case that `c` is true at all times.”  
  In other words, **`c` is guaranteed to become false at least once in the future**.

This formula does **not** impose a restriction that `c` must be false at the very beginning; it only enforces that `c` cannot stay permanently true. The earliest it may become false is in the current state, but it could also persist for a while before finally turning false. If `c` were true forever, the formula would be violated.
