**2. Parsing tree (bottom‑up)**  

```
                     ⇒
          ┌───────────────┴───────────────┐
          X b                  ¬ (X d)
          │                      │
          b                      d
```

*   **Atomic propositions**: `b` and `d`.  
*   **Temporal operator**: `X` (“next”).  
*   **Logical operator**: `¬` (“not”) and `⇒` (“implies”).

**3. Building the meaning from the leaves up**

| Sub‑formula | Meaning (in natural language) |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| `b` | “the proposition `b` holds at the current instant.” |
| `d` | “the proposition `d` holds at the current instant.” |
| `X b` | “`b` holds **in the next state** (one step ahead of the current instant).” |
| `X d` | “`d` holds **in the next state**.” |
| `¬ X d` | “It is **not** the case that `d` holds in the next state; in other words, `d` does **not** hold in the next state.” |
| `X b ⇒ ¬ X d` | “If `b` holds in the next state, then `d` does **not** hold in that same next state.” |

**4. Refined natural‑language phrasing**

> **At every moment in time: if the next instant satisfies `b`, then the next instant must **not** satisfy `d`.**  
> In other words, the propositions `b` and `d` cannot both be true in the same *next* state; `b` precludes `d` in the following instant.

---

**5. When is the formula satisfied?**

* At a current state `i`, the formula is true if either  
  * `b` is **false** in the next state (`i+1`), or  
  * `b` is **true** in the next state and simultaneously `d` is **false** in the next state.

Thus the constraint only applies at positions where `b` occurs next. If `b` never occurs in a following state, or if `b` occurs only together with `¬d`, the implication is satisfied. The formula says nothing about the current state itself or about future states beyond the immediate next one.
