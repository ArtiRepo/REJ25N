### 1.  Parsing tree (syntax tree)

```
                G
                |
           →      (implication)
         /   \
       a       F
                |
                b
```

* `G`   – **Globally** (“always”)  
* `→`   – implication (“if … then …”)  
* `a`   – atomic proposition (“a holds at the current state”)  
* `F`   – **Finally** (“eventually”)  
* `b`   – atomic proposition (“b holds at the current state”)

---

### 2.  Bottom‑up meaning reconstruction

1. **Atomic propositions**  
   *`a`*: “property “a” is true in the current state.”  
   *`b`*: “property “b” is true in the current state.”

2. **Temporal operator `F`** applied to `b`  
   `F b` means: *“at some point in the future (possibly the current state), `b` will become true.”*  
   It does **not** require `b` to be true today, just that it will be true sometime later.

3. **Implication `a → F b`**  
   This is a **point‑wise** statement: *“If `a` holds now, then `F b` must hold now.”*  
   In other words: *“If `a` is true at this moment, we are promised that `b` will become true at some future moment.”*  
   The implication is automatically true when `a` is false, so no restriction is imposed in that case.

4. **Temporal operator `G` applied to the implication**  
   `G ( a → F b )` stretches this point‑wise requirement over *all* future positions of the execution trace:  
   *“For every state that the system visits, if `a` is true in that state, then `b` must eventually become true at some state that comes after it (including possibly the same state).”*

### 3.  Refined natural‑language description

> **"At every point in time, if condition **a** holds, then the system guarantees that condition **b** will occur at some later instant (not necessarily immediately). If **a** never occurs, the formula imposes no constraint."**

---

### 4.  When the formula is satisfied

* **Scenario 1 – `a` never holds**  
  The implication `a → F b` is vacuously true at every state, therefore the whole formula holds.

* **Scenario 2 – `a` holds at some states**  
  For each such state, there must be *at least one* future state where `b` holds.  
  The occurrence of `b` can be:
  * immediately in the same state,
  * in a subsequent state,
  * after any number of intermediate states.

* **Scenario 3 – `a` holds infinitely often**  
  The system must eventually (after each occurrence of `a`) witness a `b`.  
  There is no bound on how far in the future `b` may appear; it just has to appear *somewhere* after each `a`.

---

### 5.  When the formula imposes a constraint

* Whenever `a` becomes true, the system **has to** ensure that `b` will become true sometime later.  
* If `b` fails to appear after an `a` (i.e., the future trace contains no `b` beyond that point), the implication fails, and thus the global formula becomes false.  
* No constraint is placed when `a` is false, and there is no requirement on `b` if `a` never occurs.

#### Quick reminder of other related formulas

| Formula | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `G a → F b` | “If `a` holds forever, then `b` will eventually hold.” (single global check) |
| `F a → F b` | “If `a` ever happens, then `b` eventually happens.” (one‑shot implication) |

The formula we translated, `G (a → F b)`, is **stronger** because it must hold **at every occurrence** of `a`, not just once.
