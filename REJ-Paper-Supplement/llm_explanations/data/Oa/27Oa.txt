**LTL Formula**

```
X (t ∨ w)
```

### 1.  Parsing Tree (breakdown)

```
          X
          |
       ( t ∨ w )
      /        \
     t          w
```

* **Root** – `X` (the “next” temporal operator)
* **Leaf** – `t` (atomic proposition)
* **Leaf** – `w` (atomic proposition)
* **Intermediate** – the disjunction `(t ∨ w)`

### 2.  Meaning rebuilt bottom‑up

1. **Atomic propositions**  
   *`t`* and *`w`* are simple Boolean values that can be either **true** or **false** at each time instant.

2. **Disjunction** `t ∨ w`  
   The formula `(t ∨ w)` is **true** at a particular time instant if **at least one** of the two propositions is true there.  
   *If both are false, the disjunction is false.*  

3. **Next operator** `X`  
   `X φ` holds at time `k` **iff** the subformula `φ` holds at the *next* time instant `k+1`.  
   In other words, `X (t ∨ w)` asserts that whatever the current time is, the *immediate next* state must satisfy `(t ∨ w)`.

4. **Combination** `X (t ∨ w)`  
   At time `k` the formula is satisfied exactly when **either `t` or `w` (or both)** is true at time `k+1`.  
   If *neither* proposition is true at the next step, the formula evaluates to false (and the requirement is violated).

### 3.  Refined natural‑language phrasing

- “**In the immediate next step, either `t` must be true or `w` must be true.**”  
- “**It is required that at the next time instant, one (or both) of the propositions `t` or `w` holds.**”

### 4.  When is the formula satisfied / imposed?

| Current time `k` | Condition at `k+1` | Formula satisfied? |
|------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Any state        | `t` true **or** `w` true | **Yes** |
| Any state        | Both `t` and `w` false  | **No** |

Thus, `X (t ∨ w)` is a **local, one‑step constraint**: the system must evolve from the current state into a next state where at least one of `t` or `w` holds. If the system ever finds itself in a state where this cannot happen in the next instant, the LTL property will be violated.
