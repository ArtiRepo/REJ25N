**Original LTL formula**

```
X !(t | w)
```

## 1. Parse‑tree decomposition

```
        X
        |
       ¬
        |
      ∨
     / \
    t   w
```

* **`t` and `w`** – atomic propositions (properties that may hold at a state).  
* **`∨`** – logical “or”: `t ∨ w` is true if either `t` or `w` is true (or both).  
* **`¬`** – logical “not”: `¬(t ∨ w)` flips the truth value of its operand.  
* **`X`** – the temporal “next” operator: the formula after `X` must hold in the *immediate next* state along a run.

## 2. Bottom‑up meaning reconstruction

1. **Atomic level**  
   *At a given state, `t` is true if property `t` holds; otherwise it is false.*  
   *Similarly for `w`.*

2. **Disjunction (`t ∨ w`)**  
   *For the state we are interested in, this is true when **either** `t` is true or `w` is true (or both).*

3. **Negation (`¬(t ∨ w)`)**  
   *The truth value is flipped. Thus it is true exactly when **neither** `t` nor `w` is true for that state.*

4. **Next (`X ¬(t ∨ w)`)**  
   *`X` requires the subformula to hold in the next state *after* the current one.  
   Therefore the entire expression is true at a state `s` if and only if  
   ‑ in the successor state `s'` (the state you reach after one transition),  
   ‑ both `t` and `w` are false.*

---

## 3. Natural‑language phrasing (refined)

- **Basic wording**  
  “In the immediately following state, neither `t` nor `w` holds.”

- **Rephrased for clarity**  
  *“Right after the current instant, the system must not exhibit property `t` and must not exhibit property `w`.  In the next time step, both `t` and `w` are false.”*

- **Alternative rhetorical emphasis**  
  “The next moment must bring a state where both `t` and `w` are absent.”  

---

### Summary

The LTL formula `X !(t | w)` enforces a *next‑state* constraint: at the very next point in time, the system must be in a state where **both** properties `t` **and** `w` are false. This condition must hold at every state along a run, because each state requires its successor to satisfy that “neither `t` nor `w`” condition.
