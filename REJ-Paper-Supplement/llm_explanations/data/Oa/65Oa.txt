**Original LTL Formula**

\[
\mathbf{X}\,a\; \mathbf{U}\; \mathbf{X}\,b
\]

### 1.  Parsing tree (breakdown)

```
            U
          /   \
      X a      X b
      |        |
      a        b
```

* **U** – “until” (the main connective).
* **X a** – “next‑state a”: *a* must hold **in the state that follows** the current one.
* **X b** – “next‑state b”: *b* must hold **in the state that follows** the current one.

### 2.  Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up  

1. **Bottom nodes** – they are atomic propositions:
   * *a* says “the property *a* holds”.
   * *b* says “the property *b* holds”.

2. **Unary “next” (X)** – at any state **t**,  
   * `X a` is true at *t* iff *a* is true at **t+1**.  
   * `X b` is true at *t* iff *b* is true at **t+1**.

3. **Until (U)** – \((\phi \, U \, \psi)\) is true at *t* iff  
   *there is some future time *t′* (possibly *t* itself) such that  
     – \(\psi\) is true at *t′*, and  
     – for every moment *t″* with *t* ≤ *t″* < *t′*, \(\phi\) is true at *t″*.*

   Applying this to our sub‑formulae:
   * There is a future moment *t′* where **`X b`** holds – i.e. *b* is true in the state immediately after *t′*.
   * Until that moment (not including *t′* itself), **`X a`** must hold at every intervening state – i.e. *a* is true in the state immediately after every earlier state.

### 3.  Natural‑language phrasing (refined)

> **“Soon enough, there will be a step after which the property *b* becomes true in the next state, and before that step, at every earlier step the property *a* is true in the next state.”**

In clearer terms:

* There must exist a future point *t′* such that **at time *t′ + 1* the property *b* holds.**  
* For every time *t″* strictly before *t′* (i.e. *t* ≤ *t″* < *t′*), **at time *t″ + 1* the property *a* holds.**  

So the system is required to maintain *a* “forever” in the *next* state up to the point where *b* will be true one step later. The formula does *not* constrain what happens at the present state itself; it only looks one step ahead in each position.  

When the formula is satisfied at a state *t*, there is a future index *k ≥ 0* such that:

* *b* holds at time *t + k + 1*, and  
* for all *i* with 0 ≤ *i* < *k*, *a* holds at time *t + i + 1*.

If no such *k* exists, the formula fails, meaning either *b* never becomes true in a next‑state sense, or an intermediate step occurs where *a* fails in the next‑state sense.
