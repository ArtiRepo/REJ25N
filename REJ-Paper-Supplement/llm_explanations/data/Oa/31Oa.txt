**1. Original LTL Formula**

```
d  ∧  X (c  U  a)
```

- `d`  – a proposition that must hold in the *current* state.  
- `X φ` – “in the *next* state, φ holds.”  
- `φ  U  ψ` – “φ holds *until* ψ holds (and ψ must eventually hold).”

So we need to interpret the conjunction of `d` with the “next‑state until” sub‑formula.

**2. Parsing Tree (Bottom‑up Breakdown)**  

```
                     ┌───────────────────────────────┐
                     │        “d ∧ X (c U a)”        │
                     └────────────┬──────────────────┘
                                  │
          ┌──────────────────────┴───────────────────────┐
          │                                               │
       “d”                                            “X (c U a)”
                                                          │
                                                   “c U a”
                                                    ───────
                                                    │      │
                                                   “c”    “a”
```

*Leaves*:  
- `d`  

- `c`  

- `a`  

*Inner nodes*:  

- `c U a` (until)  
- `X (c U a)` (next)  
- `d ∧ X (c U a)` (conjunction)

**3. Bottom‑up Meaning Reconstruction**

1. **`c U a`**  
   - In any state where this holds, there must be *some future* state in which `a` is true.  
   - Between the current state and that future state (excluding the future state itself), `c` must be true at every intermediate step.  
   - It does **not** say that `c` is true at the moment `a` becomes true; only until then.

2. **`X (c U a)`**  
   - Look *one step ahead*.  
   - In the *next* state, `c U a` must hold.  
   - Equivalently: at the next instant, there must be a future state (still ahead of the next instant) where `a` is true, and until that future state `c` must be true.

3. **`d ∧ X (c U a)`**  
   - The current state must satisfy `d`.  
   - And **in addition**, *from the next state onward*, the pattern described by `c U a` must be observed.

---

**4. Refined Natural‑Language Translation**

> **“The proposition `d` holds now, and from the *next* instant onward there will be a moment when `a` becomes true; until that moment, `c` must hold at every intermediate step.”**

**When the formula is satisfied**

- **At time *t***  
  - `d` is true in state *t*.  
- **There exists a time *k* ≥ *t*+1**  
  - `a(k)` is true.  
- **For every time *j* with *t*+1 ≤ *j* < *k***  
  - `c(j)` is true.  

If any of these requirements fail, the formula is violated.

**Constraints imposed on the system over time**

1. **Immediate requirement**:  
   The system must have `d` true in the current state; otherwise the formula is instantly unsatisfied.

2. **Future requirement**:  
   The system must guarantee that starting from the *next* state, it will keep `c` true continuously until it eventually reaches a state where `a` is true.  

   - If at any point after the next state `c` becomes false *before* `a` has occurred, the formula is violated.  
   - If `a` never occurs at any future point, the formula is violated (the “until” operator obliges eventuality).

3. **No requirement about the current state of `c` or `a`**:  
   The formula says nothing about whether `c` or `a` hold in the present instant; only that they have a specific behaviour beginning *after* `d` is satisfied.

### Quick “check the box” version

| Condition | Natural‑language equivalent | LTL part |
|-----------|-----------------------------|----------|
| “`d` holds now” | The current state satisfies `d`. | `d` |
| “From next instant onwards, eventually `a` happens” | There must exist a future state where `a` is true. | `X (c U a)` (part of `U`’s requirement) |
| “Until that future `a`, `c` holds at every step” | All states from the next one up to (but excluding) the state where `a` becomes true must satisfy `c`. | `c U a` |

Putting it all together gives the overall English statement shown above.
