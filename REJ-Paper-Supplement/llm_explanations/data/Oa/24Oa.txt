```
t => (x & y)
```

### 1. Parse‑Tree (Breaking the Formula Down)

```
                     =>
                   /   \
                  t    &
                      / \
                     x   y
```

- **Root**: Implication (→)
- **Left child**: Atomic proposition `t`
- **Right child**: Conjunction (∧)
  - **Left leaf**: Atomic proposition `x`
  - **Right leaf**: Atomic proposition `y`

### 2. Bottom‑Up Re‑construction of the Meaning

1. **Leaves (`t`, `x`, `y`)**  
   Each of these is an *atomic proposition*: at any given instant in time, the proposition is either true or false.

2. **Conjunction (`x & y`)**  
   This subformula is true **iff both** `x` *and* `y` are true *at the same instant*.  
   *Example:* If at time `k` we have `x(k)=true` and `y(k)=true`, then `(x & y)(k)=true`.  
   If either is false, the conjunction is false.

3. **Implication (`t => (x & y)`)**  
   An implication is true except in the single case where the antecedent (`t`) is true while the consequent (`x & y`) is false.  
   Formally:  
   - If `t(k)=false`, the whole implication is true *regardless* of `x` and `y`.  
   - If `t(k)=true`, we *require* that `(x & y)(k)=true`—i.e., that **both `x` and `y` are true at that same instant**.

Hence, the formula places a *conditional requirement* on the system’s state at each point in time.

### 3. Natural‑Language Translation (Refined)

> **Whenever the condition `t` holds, both `x` and `y` must also hold at that same moment.**

More formally:  
- **No restriction** when `t` is false.  
- **Mandatory** that `x` and `y` are true simultaneously whenever `t` becomes true.

### 4. When the Formula Is Satisfied vs. Violated

| Time \(k\) | `t(k)` | `x(k)` | `y(k)` | Evaluation of `t => (x & y)` |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------------------------------|
| any        | **false** | any   | any   | **true** – antecedent is false |
| any        | **true** | **true** | **true** | **true** – consequent satisfied |
| any        | **true** | **false** or **true** | **false** | **false** – at least one of `x` or `y` missing |

Thus:
- **Satisfied**: In all time steps, the rule holds.  
- **Violated**: Any time step where `t` is true but either `x` or `y` is false leads to an overall violation of the formula.

### 5. Practical Interpretation (System Control Perspective)

If `t` represents “the system is in a critical mode,” then `x & y` might represent “both safety locks are engaged.”  
The formula then encodes the safety policy: *in critical mode, both locks must be engaged at the exact same instant*.  
If at any instant the system enters critical mode (`t=true`) and one of the locks fails (`x=false` or `y=false`), the safety policy is breached.
