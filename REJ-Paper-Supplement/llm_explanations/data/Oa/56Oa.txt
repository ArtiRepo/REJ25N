**1. Original LTL formula**

\[
\lnot a~U~(a \land X~G~\lnot a)
\]

(Here “!a” is the same as “¬a” – “not a”.)

**2. Parsing tree – breaking the sub‑formulas**

```
                          U
              ┌───────────┴─────────────────────┐
            ¬a (left operand)           (a ∧ X G ¬a) (right operand)
                                      │          │
                                      a          X G ¬a
                                                  │
                                                  G ¬a
                                                  │
                                                  ¬a
```

* **Root** – `φ U ψ` with  
  * φ = `¬a`  
  * ψ = `a ∧ X G ¬a`

* **ψ** – conjunction  
  * left: `a` (a holds now)  
  * right: `X G ¬a` (holds *next* state and forever after)

* **X G ¬a** – “next” followed by “globally”  
  * `G ¬a` = “from this state on, `¬a` holds”.  
  * `X` says “look at the *next* state”.

**3. Rebuilding the meaning from the bottom up**

1. **`¬a`**  
   “a is false”.

2. **`G ¬a`**  
   “From this moment on, a is always false”.

3. **`X G ¬a`**  
   “From the *next* state onward, a is always false”.

4. **`a ∧ X G ¬a`**  
   At the current state:  
   * `a` is true, **and**  
   * starting with the next state and forever after, `a` will be false.

5. **`¬a U (a ∧ X G ¬a)`**  
   The until‑operator says:
   * There must exist a future position where `a ∧ X G ¬a` holds.
   * Until that position is reached, `¬a` must hold at every state.

In other words:  
*Until the first time `a` becomes true, `a` must stay false. When `a` finally turns true, it does so **exactly once**—the moment it turns true is the last moment when `a` can be true, because from the next state on `a` is forever false.*

**4. Refined natural‑language description**

> **“The system starts with `a` false.  
>  It remains `a`‑false until the very first moment `a` becomes true.  
>  That moment is the unique occurrence of `a`: at it `a` holds, immediately afterward the system guarantees that `a` will never become true again (from the next time step onward it stays false for good).”**

This captures both the *constraint* (before the first `a` must be false) and the *event* (an eventual single occurrence of `a` after which `a` can never recur).
