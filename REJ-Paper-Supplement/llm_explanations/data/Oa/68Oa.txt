**LTL formula**  
\[
\mathbf{a}\; \mathbf{U}\; \mathbf{b}
\]

### 1. Parsing tree

```
        U
       / \
      a   b
```

- **Root**: `U` (the *until* operator)  
- **Left child**: `a` (an atomic proposition)  
- **Right child**: `b` (an atomic proposition)

---

### 2. Bottom‑up semantic reconstruction

1. **Atomic propositions**  
   - `a` : “the property **a** holds in the current state.”  
   - `b` : “the property **b** holds in the current state.”

2. **Until (`U`)**  
   The subformula `a U b` is true at a given position *i* **iff**  
   * there exists a future position *k* ≥ *i* where `b` holds, and  
   * for **every** position *j* such that *i* ≤ *j* < *k*, `a` holds.

   In words: **“`a` must hold at every step up until (but not necessarily including) the first step where `b` holds, and `b` must eventually occur.”**

---

### 3. Natural‑language phrasing (refined)

> *“`a` continues to be true until `b` becomes true, and `b` is guaranteed to happen at some point in the future.”*

**When is the formula satisfied?**  
- If `b` is true in the very next state (or the current state), the formula is satisfied immediately because the “until” condition is vacuously fulfilled.
- If `b` occurs after *n* steps, then `a` must be true in all *n – 1* intermediate steps.

**What constraints does it impose?**  
- It forces the system to keep `a` true up to the first occurrence of `b`.  
- It also imposes a liveness requirement: `b` cannot be forever absent; an eventual `b` is required.  
- If `b` never occurs, the formula becomes false regardless of `a`.

In short, `a U b` says *“keep a true until b finally appears; b will appear at some future point.”*
