**Original LTL formula**

```
XXFXa
```

### 1.  Parsing tree

The syntax is unambiguous because every operator is *unary* (prefix).  
Reading left‑to‑right, each `X` or `F` applies to the formula that follows it.  

```
          X
          |
          X
          |
          F
          |
          X
          |
          a
```

So the formula is

```
X ( X ( F ( X a ) ) )
```

### 2.  Bottom‑up interpretation

| Level | Sub‑formula | LTL meaning | What it requires/limits on the system |
|-------|-------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| 0 | `a` | “The atomic proposition `a` holds in the current state.” | None yet – just a proposition. |
| 1 | `X a` | “In the *next* state, `a` holds.” | The system must make `a` true one step after now. |
| 2 | `F (X a)` | “Eventually, the property `X a` will be true.”  <br> I.e. “There is some future state where, in its next state, `a` holds.” | The system must schedule a point in the future after which `a` will become true a step later. |
| 3 | `X (F (X a))` | “In the *next* state, eventually `X a` will be true.”  <br> From the very next state, there must be some future point where `a` holds in the following step. | The system must ensure that **one step from now** there is a future point where `a` will become true one step later. |
| 4 | `X X (F (X a))` | “In the state *two* steps from now, eventually `X a` will be true.”  <br> From that point, there must be a future point where `a` holds one step after. | The system must guarantee that **within two steps** the trajectory becomes such that subsequently `a` will be true one step later. |

### 3.  Natural‑language phrasing (from the top of the tree)

> **“Two steps from the present, the system will eventually reach a state after which ‘a’ will hold in the very next state.”**

Alternate phrasing for clarity:

- “By the time we reach the state two steps ahead, from that state it must be possible to find a future moment where `a` becomes true in the following step.”  
- “Within two transitions, the system guarantees that at some later point `a` will be true immediately after that point.”

### 4.  What the formula imposes on the system

- **Timing constraint** – the requirement that something eventually happen *by the time we are at the state two steps in the future*.
- **Future flexibility** – beyond the two‑step horizon, the exact moment when `a` becomes `a`‑true is not fixed; it just has to occur sometime thereafter.
- **No immediate obligation on `a`** – `a` is not required right now, right after one step, or even immediately after two steps. It could appear many steps later, as long as it is reachable from state `t+2`.

In short, the formula promises that after a short, fixed waiting period (two steps) the system will get to a situation where it can guarantee that `a` will become true in the next step.
