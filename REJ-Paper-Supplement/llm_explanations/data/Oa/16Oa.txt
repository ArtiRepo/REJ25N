**1. Original LTL formula**  
```
F !b
```

---

**2. Parsing tree**  

```
            F (!b)
              |
            !b
              |
              b
```

- **Root**: `F (!b)` – “finally” applied to the sub‑formula `!b`.  
- **Middle node**: `!b` – logical negation of `b`.  
- **Leaf**: `b` – an atomic proposition (a Boolean variable or property that can be true or false in a state).

**3. Building the meaning bottom‑up**

| Node | Interpretation | Explanation |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| `b` | *b is true* | In the current state of the system, the proposition `b` holds. |
| `!b` | *b is false* | The negation means that `b` does **not** hold in the current state. |
| `F !b` | *At some future point (possibly now) `b` is false* | The temporal operator `F` (“finally” / “eventually”) says that there must exist an index along the infinite execution trace where the sub‑formula `!b` holds. That is, `b` will become false at least once. |

**4. Refined natural‑language translation**

> **“The system will eventually reach a state where `b` is not true.”**  
>   In other words, there must be some moment in the future—possibly the very first moment—at which the property `b` ceases to hold.  
> - If `b` is already false at the start, the requirement is satisfied immediately.  
> - If `b` stays true forever, the requirement is violated because no such future state exists.  
> - The formula places no bound on *when* this happens; it only guarantees that it will happen at least once somewhere along the execution.  

So, `F !b` is a **liveness constraint**: it rules out endless persistence of `b`; the system must at some point let go of `b`.
