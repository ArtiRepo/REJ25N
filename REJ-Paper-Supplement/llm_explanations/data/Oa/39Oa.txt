**1. Original LTL formula**

\[
b \; U \; (d \land a)
\]

**2. Parsing tree (syntax decomposition)**  

```
          U
        /   \
       b     ∧
             /  \
            d    a
```

* The root operator is `U` (Until).  
* Its left operand is the atomic proposition `b`.  
* Its right operand is a conjunction `∧` of the atomic propositions `d` and `a`.

**3. Rebuilding the meaning from the bottom up**

* **Bottom‑level subformula:** `d ∧ a`  
  *This is true iff both `d` and `a` are simultaneously true at the current state.*

* **Immediate higher level:** `b U (d ∧ a)`  
  *For a given execution trace σ = σ₀σ₁σ₂… the formula `b U (d ∧ a)` holds if and only if there exists a position k ≥ 0 such that:  
  1. At position k, the subformula `d ∧ a` is true (i.e., both `d` and `a` hold).  
  2. For every position j with 0 ≤ j < k, the atomic proposition `b` holds.*

  In words: *“`b` must keep holding at every step until we reach a step where both `d` and `a` are true. Once that step is reached, the requirement is satisfied, and nothing further is imposed by the formula."*

**4. Natural‑language phrasing (refined for clarity)**

> **“`b` must stay true all the way up to a point where both `d` and `a` become true simultaneously.**
> 
>  * The system is forced to maintain `b` up to and **just before** the first occurrence of the joint truth of `d` and `a`.  
>  * When the state where `d` and `a` are both true finally appears, the formula is considered satisfied, even if `b` turns false afterward.  
>  * If there is **no future point** where both `d` and `a` hold together, the formula is never satisfied (the requirement can never be fulfilled).*

### Quick recap
- **Syntax tree:** `b` **U** (`d` **∧** `a`).  
- **Semantics:** “`b` holds continuously until the first time both `d` and `a` become true.”  
- **Implication:** The system must not violate `b` before that joint event; after the event, the formula imposes no more constraints.
