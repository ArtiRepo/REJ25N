**1.  Original LTL formula**

\[
\boxed{(a \; U \; b)\;\; \wedge\;\; \mathbf{G}\,a}
\]

*U* = “until”,  *G* = “globally” (true at every point in time).

**2.  Parsing tree (breakdown)**  

```
            ∧
           / \
          U   G
         / \   \
        a   b   a
```

- Root: conjunction `∧`  
- Left child: `U` (until) with operands `a` and `b`  
- Right child: `G` (globally) with operand `a`

**3.  Bottom‑up reconstruction of meaning**

| Sub‑formula | What it requires | With the rest of the formula |
|-------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| `G a` | `a` must hold **at every moment** of the execution | Imposes a perpetual condition, no matter what else occurs |
| `a U b` | `b` has to occur **at least once in the future**, and **until the first occurrence of `b`, `a` must hold at every instant** | The “until” part guarantees a point where `b` is true, but also requires `a` before that point. After `b` has happened, the “until” no longer constrains `a`. |

Now combine the two pieces:

- `G a` already forces `a` to hold at **every** instant, before *any* `b` and also after the first `b`.  
- `a U b` just says that a `b` **must happen sometime**; because `G a` is already true at those earlier times, the "until" condition is automatically satisfied as long as `b` occurs.  
- Consequently the conjunction enforces **two** constraints simultaneously:

  1. `a` is true forever (`G a`).  
  2. `b` will eventually become true (`F b` – “finally”/“eventually”), because `a U b` implies that `b` must happen at some point.

**4.  Refined natural‑language phrasing**

> **“The system must keep the property **a** true all the time, and at some point in the future it must also make the property **b** true.”**

This phrasing makes clear that:

- **Satisfaction**: The run satisfies the formula if `a` never becomes false, and there is at least one moment where `b` holds.  
- **Constraint**: Any correct run is forced to:
  - never stop satisfying `a` for any instant, and
  - eventually achieve `b` (but `b` can appear at any time; once it does, the `until` condition is fulfilled, albeit `a` continues to hold because of `G a`).

In temporal‑logic jargon the formula is equivalent to the pair \( \mathbf{G}\,a \land \mathbf{F}\,b \) (“always a” AND “eventually b”).
