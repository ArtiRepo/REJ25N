**Original LTL formula**

```
F x | F y
```

(Here `F` is the “eventually” (future‑sometime) operator, and `|` denotes logical OR.)

### 1. Parsing tree (breakdown)

```
            ──OR──
           /      \
         ──F──   ──F──
          |        |
          x        y
```

- **Root node**: `|` (OR)
- **Left subtree**: `F x`
  - `F` applied to the atomic proposition `x`
- **Right subtree**: `F y`
  - `F` applied to the atomic proposition `y`

---

### 2. Bottom‑up reconstruction of meaning  

1. **Atomic propositions**  
   - `x`: “property `x` holds”  
   - `y`: “property `y` holds”

2. **Future operators**  
   - `F x`: “at some point in the future, `x` will become true.”  
   - `F y`: “at some point in the future, `y` will become true.”

3. **Logical OR** (`|`)  
   - Combines the two futures: the whole formula is satisfied **if either**  
     - `F x` is satisfied **or**  
     - `F y` is satisfied (or both).

So the tree tells us that the formula is true at a given state iff, along the run, there's **some** future time where either `x` holds or `y` holds.

### 3. Refined natural‑language phrasing

> **“Eventually, either property `x` will become true, or property `y` will become true (or both sometime in the future).”**

#### When the formula is satisfied  

- If on a given execution you can find a future step at which `x` is true, the formula holds.  
- If `x` never becomes true but there is a future step where `y` is true, the formula also holds.  
- If both `x` and `y` become true at some points (possibly the same time or different times), the formula is still satisfied.

#### When it imposes constraints on the system

- The formula **prevents** the system from running forever without ever making `x` true **and** without ever making `y` true.  
- If the system can continue indefinitely with neither `x` nor `y` ever becoming true, the formula would be violated.

In summary, `F x | F y` expresses a minimal future requirement: **at some point, one of the two propositions must occur**. It does not say *when* or *how often*, only that *at least once* one of them will appear.
