**1. Original LTL formula**

```
F (!y & w)
```

---

**2. Parsing tree**

```
         F
         |
        &        (conjunction)
       / \
   !y     w
   |
   y
```

- The outermost operator is **F** (eventually).  
- Inside it we have a conjunction **&**.  
- The left conjunct is a negation **!** applied to the atomic proposition **y**.  
- The right conjunct is the atomic proposition **w** itself.

**3. Bottom‑up reconstruction of meaning**

| Tree level | Sub‑formula | Semantic interpretation |
|------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Atomic propositions** | `y`, `w` | Observables of the system (“y holds” / “w holds”). |
| **Negation** | `!y` | “y does not hold” (i.e., y is false). |
| **Conjunction** | `!y & w` | Both conditions must be true *together* at the same instant:  
  *w is true* **and** *y is false*. |
| **Eventually** | `F (!y & w)` | “At some future point along the execution trace, the condition `(!y & w)` becomes true.”  
  It does **not** constrain the past or immediate present; it simply demands that the system eventually reach a state where w is true and y is false. |

**4. Refined natural‑language phrasing**

> **“The system must, at some point in the future, observe `w` being true while `y` is false.”**

Or, phrased more informally:

> *“Eventually the system will enter a state where `w` holds and `y` does not.”*

---

**Implications for the system**

- **Constraint type**: This is a **liveness** requirement – a guarantee that a particular situation will happen at some future time, not something that must always hold.
- **When it is satisfied**: If, during a run, there exists a step *k* such that `w` is true at step *k* and `y` is false at the same step, regardless of what happened before, the formula holds.
- **When it is violated**: If the execution ends (or continues forever) without ever reaching a state where `w` is true while `y` is false. (If the model is infinite, the formula fails if no such step ever occurs.)

Thus, the formula enforces that the system cannot forever avoid the situation “`w` true and `y` false” – it must eventually experience it.
