            X
            |
            F
            |
            a
```

*   **a** – atomic proposition  
*   **F** – “eventually” (true at the current instant or at some future instant)  
*   **X** – “next” (move one step forward along the system’s execution)  
*   The outer **X** applies to the whole inner subformula *XFa*.

**3. Bottom‑up rebuild of meaning**

| Level | Sub‑formula | Interpretation |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 0 | **a** | “The proposition **a** holds in the current state.” |
| 1 | **F a** | “At some time point from now onward (including now), **a** will be true.” |
| 2 | **X (F a)** | “In the *next* state, the property *there exists a future state in which **a** holds* will be true.” |
| 3 | **X X (F a)** | “In *two* steps from the current state, *there exists a future state in which **a** holds* will be true.” |

Thus the whole formula says: **At the state that is exactly two transitions ahead, it must eventually become true that the proposition `a` holds at some point in the future (not necessarily immediately at that state).**

**4. Natural‑language phrasing and explanation**

> **“From the current moment, after two transitions, there will be a future point where the proposition `a` is true.”**

- **When it is satisfied**:  
  Starting from the present state, locate the state reached after two transitions.  
  From that state onward, there must exist at least one future state in which `a` holds.  
  *The exact timing of `a` after the two-step horizon can be any number of steps; even `a` can hold in that very state.*

- **What constraints it imposes**:  
  - **No restriction on the first two steps** – `a` may or may not hold during the first two transitions.  
  - **Mandatory eventuality after step 2** – once we are two steps ahead, the system is forced to eventually reach a state where `a` is true.  

In other words, the formula guarantees that *from step 2 onward, `a` will occur eventually*, but it places no requirement on `a` before that point.
