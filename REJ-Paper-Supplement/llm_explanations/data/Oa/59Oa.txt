**Explanation of the nodes**

| Node | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `a` | The atomic proposition **a** holds at the current instant. |
| `X a` | **a** holds at the *next* instant. |
| `∧` | Conjunction: both left and right sub‑formulas must hold. |
| `¬a` | Logical negation: **a** is *false* at the current instant. |
| `X` (before `¬a`) | ‘Next’ operator applied to `¬a`; tells us that `¬a` must hold one step later. |
| `XX ¬a` | Twice applying `X`: `¬a` must hold *two* steps after the instant at which the implication is evaluated. |
| `→` | Logical implication. |
| `G` | Global (always) operator – the whole implication must hold at every instant of the run. |

## 2. Bottom‑up reconstruction of meaning

1. **Atomic level**  
   - `a` : “the proposition a is true now.”  
   - `¬a` : “the proposition a is false now.”

2. **Next‑operator level**  
   - `X a` : “a is true in the next state.”  
   - `X ¬a` : “a is false in the next state.”  
   - `XX ¬a` : “a is false two steps from now” (next of “next of ¬a”).

3. **Conjunction**  
   - `a ∧ X a` : “a is true now **and** a is true in the very next instant.”  
   - So we are witnessing a *run of at least two consecutive a’s*.

4. **Implication**  
   - `(a ∧ X a) → XX ¬a` says  
     “If we are in a scenario where a is true now and in the next step, then *two* steps later a must be false.”  
   - Violations: if a holds for two consecutive steps but remains true two steps afterward, the implication fails at that instant.

5. **Global**  
   - `G(...)` enforces that the above condition must hold **at every instant** of the system’s execution.  
   - Thus, *whenever* we see two consecutive a’s, it is mandatory that a cannot still hold two steps ahead.

## 3. Refined natural‑language description

> **For every point in time, if proposition *a* is true at that point **and** also true at the following step, then in exactly two steps from now the proposition *a* must be false.**

In other words, **you cannot keep the property a true for more than one consecutive step without an immediate break: as soon as you have a run of a’s of length two, the run must terminate by the second step later.**  

This constraint is enforced globally, so the pattern *a, a, …* is only allowed if the third instant after any such double‑a is a non‑a state. Any run that has `a` true at times `t` and `t+1` but also `a` true at `t+2` would violate the formula at time `t`.
