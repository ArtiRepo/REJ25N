**1. Original LTL formula**  
```
F(a ∧ b)
```

**2. Parsing tree (breakdown)**  

```
          F
          |
        ∧
        / \
       a   b
```
- **Leaves**: the atomic propositions `a` and `b`  
- **Next level up**: the conjunction `a ∧ b`  
- **Root**: the future operator `F`, meaning “eventually”

**3. Rebuilding the meaning from the bottom up**

*Bottom level – atomic propositions*  
- `a` is true at the current instant iff the event/condition *a* holds right now.  
- `b` is true at the current instant iff the event/condition *b* holds right now.

*Second level – conjunction*  
- `a ∧ b` is true at the current instant iff **both** `a` and `b` are true **at the same instant**.

*Top level – eventuality*  
- `F(a ∧ b)` is true in a run if **there exists some future time step (possibly the current one)** where the sub‑formula `a ∧ b` holds. In other words, “there will come a time stamp at which *a* and *b* are simultaneously satisfied.”

**4. Refined natural‑language interpretation**

> **“The system will eventually reach a state in which both *a* and *b* hold at the same time.”**

**When is the property satisfied?**  
- The formula holds if, at any point along the execution trace, both `a` and `b` become true together.  
- It is immediately satisfied if the current state already has `a` and `b` true.

**What constraint does it impose?**  
- If the system can get stuck in a region where `a` and `b` never coincide, the property is violated.  
- To satisfy the formula, the design must guarantee that it is *possible* (and eventually) to reach a state where both conditions are true together—otherwise the spec will be falsified.  

Thus, `F(a ∧ b)` expresses an **eventual simultaneous satisfaction** of `a` and `b` over time.
