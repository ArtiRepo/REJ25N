**Original LTL formula**

```
a -> XXXa
```

## 1.  Parse tree (breakdown)

```
                      (→)
                     /   \
                    a    (X)
                          |
                          (X)
                          |
                          (X)
                          |
                          a
```

* **Top node**: implication (`→`)  
* **Left child**: atomic proposition `a`  
* **Right child**: a chain of three successive `X` (Next) operators applied to `a`.

## 2.  Rebuilding meaning bottom‑up

1. **Atomic part** – `a`  
   *“the proposition `a` holds (is true) at the current state.”*

2. **First `X`** – `X a`  
   *“in the *next* state, `a` will hold.”*

3. **Second `X`** – `X (X a)`  
   *“in two steps from now, `a` will hold.”*

4. **Third `X`** – `X (X (X a)) ≡ XXXa`  
   *“exactly three steps from now (i.e., after three successive ‘next’ transitions), `a` will hold.”*

5. **Implication** – `a → XXXa`  
   *“If `a` is true in the current state, then the truth of `a` is guaranteed to re‑appear precisely three steps later.”*

---

## 3.  Natural‑language phrasing (refined)

> **“Whenever the proposition `a` is true at some instant, it must also be true exactly three time steps later.”**

### What the formula *requires*

* **Across all time points** `t` (the formula is evaluated globally on an infinite trace):  
  - If `a` holds at time `t`, then it must hold at time `t+3`.
  - There is *no* requirement that `a` holds at `t+1` or `t+2`; those intermediate states can be arbitrary.
  - If `a` is false at time `t`, the implication is automatically satisfied (vacuously true).

### When the formula is *violated*

* The only way a run can violate `a → XXXa` is by encountering a time `t` where:
  1. `a` is true at time `t`, **and**
  2. `a` is false at time `t+3` (or the trace ends before `t+3`).

Thus the property enforces a *three‑step delayed persistence* of `a`. It is a safety‑like constraint, but unlike a pure safety property it allows `a` to be false in the intermediate steps.
