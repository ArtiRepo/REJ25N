**Original LTL formula**

```
(b | !a) & X (d U c)
```

### 1.  Parsing tree (bottom‑up breakdown)

```
            &                                 <-- Root: conjunction
          /   \
  (b | !a)     X (d U c)                        <-- Two children

        |                                X
      /   \                              \
    b      !a                          (d U c)

                      U
                     / \
                    d   c
```

- **Left subtree** – `(b | !a)`  
  *Or* between the proposition `b` and the negation of `a`.

- **Right subtree** – `X (d U c)`  
  *Next* operator applied to the subformula `(d U c)`.

- **Inner subformula** – `(d U c)`  
  *Until* between `d` (the “before” part) and `c` (the “until” part).

### 2.  Reconstructing meaning from the bottom

| Sub‑formula | Natural‑language interpretation |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| **d** | the atomic proposition “d is true”. |
| **c** | the atomic proposition “c is true”. |
| **(d U c)** | “**d holds at every point until a point where **c** becomes true**.”<br>Formally, there exists some future position in which `c` is true, and for all earlier positions `< the first c`, `d` is true. |
| **X (d U c)** | “**In the next state, the property (d U c) must hold**.”<br>Thus starting one step from the present, `d` must continue to hold until `c` eventually becomes true. |
| **!a** | “**a is false**.” |
| **(b | !a)** | “Either **b is true** or **a is false** (or both).” |
| **(b | !a) & X (d U c)** | “Both of the following must be true simultaneously: 1) at the current time either `b` holds or `a` does not hold, and 2) at the next time instant the system must enter a period where `d` holds continuously until (at some later point) `c` becomes true.” |

---

### 3.  Refined natural‑language phrasing

> **"At this moment, the system must satisfy either that `b` holds or that `a` does not hold.  Additionally, immediately in the next time step, it must be that `d` continues to hold until, at some future point, `c` becomes true."**

**Notes on the semantics**

- If `c` is true already in the next state, the “until” is trivially satisfied: no requirement that `d` hold at that state.
- If `c` does not become true for ever, the formula is **not** satisfied; the “until” part demands eventual occurrence of `c`.
- The conjunction (`&`) requires *both* conditions to hold at the respective times, so violating either one will make the entire formula false.
