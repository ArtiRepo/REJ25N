### 1.  Original LTL formula  
\[
\boxed{\mathbf{G}(a \;\rightarrow\; b)}
\]

This formula reads: “Globally, `a` implies `b`.”

### 2.  Parsing tree (syntactic breakdown)

```
           G
           |
        →   (implication)
       / \
      a   b
```

* **Root** – The GLOBAL operator `G` (read “always” or “for all time steps”).
* **Child of G** – The implication `→`.
* **Leaf nodes** – Atomic propositions `a` and `b`.

---

### 3.  Bottom‑up reconstruction of meaning

1. **Leaf level**  
   *`a`* – “the property `a` holds at the current time step.”  
   *`b`* – “the property `b` holds at the current time step.”

2. **Implication**  
   *`a → b`* – “Whenever `a` holds at a time step, `b` also holds at the same time step.”  
   (If `a` is false, the implication is true regardless of `b`.)

3. **Global operator**  
   *`G(φ)`* – “The property `φ` is true at **every** time step of the execution.’  

Applying this to `φ = a → b` gives:

> “At every time step, if `a` holds then `b` must also hold.”

---

### 4.  Refined natural‑language phrasing

> **Constraint**: In any execution, `a` can never be true without `b` being true **at the same moment**.  
> Equivalently: *`a` is only allowed when `b` is also true*.  
> 
> The formula imposes no further restrictions on the system—if `a` never occurs, the requirement is trivially satisfied.  
> But as soon as `a` holds, `b` must hold immediately; otherwise the system violates the specification.

(Notice that this is a **strict temporal constraint**: it does not specify when `b` has to become true relative to a future occurrence of `a`; the requirement is at the same instant.)
