### Reasoning for LTL Formula: `XXXa`

#### 1. **Original LTL Formula**  
`XXXa`

#### 2. **Breakdown into Parsing Tree**  
The formula is parsed hierarchically:  
- **Top-level operator**: `X` (Next), applied to the subformula `XXa`.  
  - **Subformula `XXa`**:  
    - **Operator**: `X` (Next), applied to `Xa`.  
      - **Subformula `Xa`**:  
        - **Operator**: `X` (Next), applied to `a`.  
          - **Atomic proposition**: `a`.  

**Parsing Tree**:  
```
    X   (outermost)
     |
     X  
     |
     X  
     |
     a  
```

#### 3. **Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up**  
- **Step 1 (Innermost `Xa`)**  
  - Formula: `Xa`  
  - Meaning:  
    *"In the next moment of the system execution, `a` has to hold."*  

- **Step 2 (Middle `X(Xa)` or `XXa`)**  
  - Formula: `X(Xa)`  
  - Meaning:  
    Apply `X` to `Xa`:  
    *"In the next moment, the subformula `Xa` must hold."*  
    Substitute inner meaning:  
    *"In the next moment, it must be true that (in the next moment after that, `a` holds)."*  
    → Simplified: *"After two consecutive moments from now, `a` must hold."*  

- **Step 3 (Outermost `X(XXa)` or `XXXa`)**  
  - Formula: `X(XXa)`  
  - Meaning:  
    Apply `X` to `XXa`:  
    *"In the next moment, the subformula `XXa` must hold."*  
    Substitute prior step:  
    *"In the next moment, it must be true that (after two consecutive moments from that point, `a` holds)."*  
    → **Final meaning**: Each `X` shifts focus "one moment later."  
      - Current time = `t`  
      - After first `X`: `t+1`  
      - After second `X`: `t+2`  
      - After third `X`: `t+3`  
    → *"At the third consecutive moment from now, `a` must hold."*  

#### 4. **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**  
- **Explicit Timing**: Use sequential shift language for clarity.  
- **Avoid Ambiguity**: Specify "consecutive" to emphasize stepwise progression.  
- **Clarity**: Directly state the temporal offset.  

**Final Translation**:  
`XXXa` means:  
*"In the next moment of the system execution, the next moment after that, and the next moment after that—so after three moments in total—the proposition `a` must hold."*  

**Optimized for Conciseness**:  
*"After exactly three consecutive steps in the execution, `a` becomes true."*
