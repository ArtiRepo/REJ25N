### LTL Formula Translation: `X a => X c`

#### 1. **Original LTL Formula**  
   `X a => X c`  

#### 2. **Parse Tree Breakdown**  
   - **Root**: Implication operator (`=>`).  
     - **Left child**: `X a` (Next operator applied to `a`).  
     - **Right child**: `X c` (Next operator applied to `c`).  
   - **Atomic propositions**:  
     - `a` and `c` are propositional variables.  

#### 3. **Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up**  
   - **Step 1: Innermost formulas (atomic propositions)**  
     - `a`: "Proposition `a` holds in the current state."  
     - `c`: "Proposition `c` holds in the current state."  
   - **Step 2: Apply `X` (Next) to left/right branches**:  
     - `X a`: **"At the next state, `a` holds."**  
     - `X c`: **"At the next state, `c` holds."**  
   - **Step 3: Apply implication (`=>`)**  
     - `X a => X c`:  
       *General meaning of `P => Q`*: "If `P` is true, then `Q` must be true."  
       Here, `P = X a` and `Q = X c`, so:  
       **"If (at the next state, `a` holds), then (at the next state, `c` holds)."**  

#### 4. **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**  
   - **Optimize for clarity and conciseness**:  
     The phrase references "the next state" twice. Since both `X a` and `X c` refer to the **same future state**, we merge the reference:  
     > "**If `a` holds in the next state, then `c` must hold in that same next state.**"  
     - *Clearer rephrasing*:  
       > "**At the next state, if `a` is true, then `c` must be true.**"  

<u>Final Translation</u>:  
**"In the next state, if `a` holds, then `c` must hold."**

### Key Takeaways for Reading LTL  
1. **Start atomic**: Parse variables first (e.g., `a`, `c`).  
2. **Apply operators innermost-first**:  
   - `X` (Next) binds directly to a variable: `X a` → "`a` in the next state".  
3. **Handle implications**:  
   - `P => Q` → "If (P) then (Q)". Ensure temporal alignment (here, both `X a` and `X c` refer to the **same next state**).  
4. **Simplify phrasing**: Merge repeated temporal references (e.g., "the next state" appears once, covering both conditions).
