### Translation of LTL Formula: F (o U u)

#### Step 1: Original LTL Formula  
**F (o U u)**  

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
- **Top operator**: `F` (eventually)  
  - **Child**: `(o U u)` (until)  
    - **Left child**: `o` (atomic proposition)  
    - **Right child**: `u` (atomic proposition)  

Tree structure:  
```
    F
     |
     U
    / \
   o   u
```

#### Step 3: Rebuild Meaning from Bottom Up  
1. **Atomic propositions**:  
   - `o` means "`o` holds."  
   - `u` means "`u` holds."  

2. **Subformula `(o U u)`**:  
   - `(o U u)` means:  
     *"There exists a future time `j` where `u` holds, and for all times from **now** to `j-1`, `o` holds continuously."*  
   - Example: If evaluated at time `t`, it requires:  
     - `u` to hold at some `j ≥ t`,  
     - `o` to hold at every `k` where `t ≤ k < j`.  

3. **Outermost operator `F`**:  
   - `F (o U u)` means:  
     *"There exists a future time `i` where `(o U u)` holds."*  
   - This shifts the starting point: `(o U u)` is evaluated **starting from `i`**, not necessarily from the current time.  

Combined:  
- At some future `i`, `(o U u)` holds →  
  - At `i`, there is a `j ≥ i` where:  
    - `u` holds at `j`,  
    - `o` holds at every `k` in `[i, j-1]`.  

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Phrasing  
- **Literal translation**:  
  *"Eventually, at some future moment `i`, `o` will hold continuously from `i` until a later moment `j-1`, and `u` will hold at `j`."*  

- **Key simplification**:  
  The formula **does not require `o` to hold before `i` or after `j`**. Crucially, `i` can equal `j` (if `u` holds at `i`, the interval `[i, j-1]` is empty, so `o` is vacuously satisfied). Thus:  
  > **F (o U u) ≡ F u**  
  *"Eventually, `u` will hold (regardless of `o`)."*  

- **Final concise phrasing**:  
  **"Eventually, `u` will hold."**  

#### Reasoning Summary  
- `(o U u)` at time `i` forces `u` to eventually hold from `i` onward, with `o` holding until then.  
- `F` allows choosing `i` as the exact time `u` holds (`i = j`), making the `o`-requirement vacuous.  
- Thus, the formula reduces to **`F u`**.
