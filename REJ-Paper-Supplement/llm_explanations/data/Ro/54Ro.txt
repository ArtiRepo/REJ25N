### Original LTL Formula:
(a U b) and G(a)

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Breakdown into Parsing Tree:**
   - The formula has two main components joined by an `and` operator:
     - Left subformula: `(a U b)` (the "until" operator)
     - Right subformula: `G(a)` (the "globally" operator)
   - Further breakdown:
     - `a U b`:  
       - `a` must hold continuously until `b` becomes true.  
       - `b` must eventually become true at some future moment.  
     - `G(a)`:  
       - `a` must hold at **every** moment in the entire execution.

2. **Rebuild Meaning from Bottom Up:**
   - **Base propositions:**  
     - `a` is a proposition that may hold at individual moments.  
     - `b` is a proposition that may hold at individual moments.  
   - **Subformula `(a U b)`:**  
     - "At some future moment, `b` must hold, and `a` must hold continuously **until** that moment (but not necessarily at the moment `b` holds)."  
   - **Subformula `G(a)`:**  
     - "`a` must hold **at every moment** throughout the entire execution."  
   - **Combine with `and`:**  
     - Both conditions must hold simultaneously:  
       - `(a U b)` requires `b` to eventually happen (with `a` holding until then).  
       - `G(a)` requires `a` to hold forever.  

3. **Key Observations for Semantics:**  
   - `G(a)` forces `a` to hold at **all times**, including:  
     - The moments *before* `b` occurs (covered by `a U b`).  
     - The moment *when* `b` occurs.  
     - *After* `b` occurs (not required by `a U b` alone).  
   - Thus, `G(a)` implies that `a` holds continuously even after `b` occurs.  
   - The `(a U b)` subformula only requires `a` to hold until `b` occurs (not after), but `G(a)` extends this to perpetuity.  
   - The sole distinct requirement from `(a U b)` is that **`b` must eventually occur**.  

4. **Refined Natural Language Phrasing:**  
   - "`a` must hold **at every moment** for the entire execution, and `b` must **eventually hold** at some moment."  
   - **Why concise:**  
     - `G(a)` ensures `a` holds forever, satisfying the `a`-until-`b` condition trivially (since `a` holds *everywhere* anyway).  
     - The only added constraint from `(a U b)` is the **eventual occurrence** of `b`.  

### Final Translation:
**(a U b) and G(a)** means:  
"`a` must hold continuously at every moment of the system execution, and `b` must eventually hold at some future moment."  

### Key Insight:
The formula reduces to **`G(a) ∧ F(b)`** (i.e., "`a` always holds, and `b` eventually holds") because `G(a)` dominates the timing constraints for `a`, leaving only the eventuality of `b` from `(a U b)`.
