### Translation of LTL Formula: **(d | !b) U !a**

**1. Original LTL Formula:**  
`(d | !b) U !a`

**2. Parsing Tree Breakdown:**  
- **Root operator:** `U` (Until)  
  - **Left child:** Disjunction `(d | !b)`  
    - *d* (atomic proposition)  
    - `!b` (Negation of atomic proposition `b`)  
  - **Right child:** `!a` (Negation of atomic proposition `a`)  

Tree structure:  
```
      U  
     / \  
    /   \  
 (d | !b) !a  
  /   \  
 d     !b  
        \  
         b (negated)  
```

**3. Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up:**  
- **Atomic propositions:**  
  - `d`: "`d` holds"  
  - `b`: "`b` holds" → `!b`: "`b` **does not hold**"  
  - `a`: "`a` holds" → `!a`: "`a` **does not hold**"  

- **Left subformula (`d | !b`):**  
  "`d` holds OR `b` does not hold."  
  (True if either `d` is true or `b` is false at any moment.)  

- **Root operator (`U`):**  
  The `(d | !b) U !a` requires:  
  1. `!a` must **eventually hold** at some future moment.  
  2. Until `!a` holds, `(d | !b)` must hold **continuously** (at every moment before and including the moment `!a` becomes true).  

**4. Refined Natural Language Phrasing:**  
> "**At every moment of the system execution until (and including) the first time `a` becomes false, either `d` holds or `b` is false. Furthermore, `a` must eventually become false.**"  

### Key Clarifications:
- **Temporal Scope:**  
  Condition `(d | !b)` must hold **uninterruptedly** from the start until the exact moment `a` becomes false.  
- **Termination Requirement:**  
  The formula mandates that `a` **must eventually become false**—the system cannot satisfy the formula if `a` stays true forever.  
- **Inclusive "Until":**  
  Condition `(d | !b)` must hold **at the moment `a` becomes false** (i.e., in the same state where `!a` occurs).  

### Comparison to Initial Example (`X !e & X f`):  
- Similar step-by-step parsing of operators (e.g., breaking `!b`/`!a` as negations, `|` as disjunction, `U` with temporal constraints).  
- Focus on temporal keywords: "until" and "eventually" for `U`, atomic propositions mapped to system events.  
- Explicit inclusion of constraints ("must hold continuously," "must eventually occur").
