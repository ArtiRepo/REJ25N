### Translation Reasoning for `G(a or b)`  

#### Original LTL Formula  
`G(a or b)`  

#### Parsing Tree Breakdown  
1. **Root operator**: `G` (Globally).  
2. **Subformula**: `(a or` `b)`  
   - **Operators**: `or` (logical disjunction).  
   - **Atomic propositions**: `a,` `b`.  

Tree structure:  
```
     G  
      |  
     OR  
    /   \  
   a     b  
```  

#### Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up  
1. **Atomic propositions**:  
   - `a`: "`a` holds" (at a given moment).  
   - `b`: "`b` holds" (at a given moment).  
2. **Disjunction (`or`)**:  
   - Combines `a` and `b` → "`a` holds **or** `b` holds" (at a specific moment).  
3. **Global operator (`G`)**:  
   - Applies to `(a or b)` → "**At every future moment**, `a` holds or `b` holds" (from now onward).  

#### Refined Natural Language Phrasing  
- **Basic NL**: "At every moment in the system execution, `a` holds or `b` holds."  
- **Clarity refinements**:  
  - Explicitly define temporal scope to match `G` (all moments).  
  - Replace "holds" with clearer wording (e.g., "is true").  
  - Clarify `or` includes cases where only `a`, only `b`, or both are true.  
  - Remove redundancy ("from now onward" is implied by `G`).  

**Final Translation**:  
> **"At every moment of the system execution, `a` must be true or `b` must be true (or both)."**  

### Key Interpretation Insights  
- **`G` dominates**: The entire subformula `(a or b)` is governed universally over time.  
- **No sequentiality**: Unlike `X` (next), `G` covers **all** moments equally.  
- **Inclusive `or`**: Both `a` and `b` can be true simultaneously—no mutual exclusion.  
- **Practical reading**: The system **never** reaches a state where both `a` and `b` are false.
