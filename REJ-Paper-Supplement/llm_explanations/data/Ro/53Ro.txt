### LTL Formula Translation: Fa -> Gb

#### Original LTL Formula
- **Fa -> Gb**

#### Parsing Tree Breakdown
```
     Implication (->)
     /           \
    F a         G b
    / \         / \
   F   a       G   b
```
- **Leaf nodes**: Atomic propositions `a` and `b`.
- **Next level**: 
  - `F a`: The "eventually" operator (`F`) applied to `a`.
  - `G b`: The "globally" operator (`G`) applied to `b`.
- **Root**: Implication (`->`) between `F a` and `G b`.

#### Rebuilding Meaning from Bottom Up
1. **Atomic propositions**:
   - `a`: "`a` holds."
   - `b`: "`b` holds."
   
2. **Subformulas**:
   - **`F a`**: "At **some future moment**, `a` holds."  
     (An event where `a` becomes true eventually occurs.)
   - **`G b`**: "At **every future moment** (including now), `b` holds."  
     (`b` must be true continuously from the current state onward.)

3. **Implication (`Fa -> Gb`)**:
   - Logical structure: **If `F a` is true, then `G b` must be true**.
   - Meaning: If the system reaches a state where `a` holds at some future point, then `b` must hold **globally** (at every moment, including now and before/after `a`).

#### Refined Natural Language Phrasing
- **Initial phrasing**: "If eventually `a` holds, then globally `b` holds."
- **Refined for clarity**:  
  > **"If at any future moment `a` becomes true, then `b` must hold at every moment from the current state onward."**

#### Key Insights
- **Implication scope**: The formula is satisfied if either:
  - (a) `a` **never occurs** in the future (making `F a` false), or
  - (b) `b` **holds continuously** (now and forever) whenever `a` occurs.
- **Critical nuance**: If `a` occurs at time `t`, `G b` requires `b` to be true **starting at the initial state**, not just after `t`. Thus, `b` must hold both *before and after* `a` occurs.
- **Equivalent logic**:  
  `Fa -> Gb` ≡ `¬Fa ∨ Gb` ≡ "Either `a` never occurs, or `b` holds everywhere." 

This reflects a strong constraint: The mere **possibility** of `a` (even once) forces `b` to hold **throughout the entire execution**.
