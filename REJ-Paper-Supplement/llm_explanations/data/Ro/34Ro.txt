### Translation of LTL Formula: G (!f | !i)

#### Original LTL Formula:
`G (!f | !i)`

#### Parsing Tree Breakdown:
1. **Root operator**: `G` (Globally).  
   - Child: `!f | !i` (disjunction).  
2. **Disjunction (`|`)** breaks into:  
   - Left child: `!f` (negation of `f`).  
     - Grandchild: `f` (atomic proposition).  
   - Right child: `!i` (negation of `i`).  
     - Grandchild: `i` (atomic proposition).  

**Tree Structure**:
```
     G
     |
     OR
    /   \
  NOT   NOT
  |      |
  f      i
```

#### Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up:
1. **Atomic propositions**:  
   - `f` means "`f` holds".  
   - `i` means "`i` holds".  
<br>
2. **Apply negations**:  
   - `!f` → "`f` does **not** hold".  
   - `!i` → "`i` does **not** hold".  
<br>
3. **Apply disjunction (`|`)**:  
   - `!f | !i` → **"`f` does not hold OR `i` does not hold"**.  
     Equivalently: **"It is not the case that both `f` and `i` hold simultaneously"**.  
<br>
4. **Apply global operator (`G`)**:  
   - `G (!f | !i)` → **"At every moment in the system execution, `f` does not hold OR `i` does not hold"**.  
     Or rephrased: **"Globally, `f` and `i` are never true at the same time"**.  

#### Refined Natural Language Phrasing:
> **"Throughout the entire system execution, `f` and `i` can never both be true in the same state."**  

### Key Reasoning Summary:
- **`G` (Globally)** → Constraint over **all** future states.  
- **`|` (Disjunction)** → Logical **OR** (at least one subformula must hold).  
- **`!` (Negation)** → Flips the truth value (e.g., `!f` ≡ "`f` is false").  
- **Combined meaning**:  
  The disjunction `!f | !i` forces **exclusion** between `f` and `i` in every state.  
  - If `f` is true, `i` must be false.  
  - If `i` is true, `f` must be false.  
  - Both can also be false, but **never simultaneous true**.
