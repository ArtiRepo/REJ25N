### Translation of LTL Formula: `!X !(w | x)`

**Original LTL Formula:**  
`!X !(w | x)`

---

#### Step 1: Parsing Tree (Breakdown)  
Break down the formula from the **innermost subformula** to the outermost:  
- **Leaf level:** Atoms `w` and `x`.  
- **Level 1:** Disjunction `(w | x)` ("`w` or `x` holds").  
- **Level 2:** Negation `!(w | x)` ("`w` and `x` **both fail**").  
- **Level 3:** Next-operator `X !(w | x)` ("**In the next moment**, `w` and `x` both fail").  
- **Level 4:** Outer negation `!X !(w | x)` ("It is **false** that in the next moment, `w` and `x` both fail").  

#### Step 2: Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up  
- **Start:** `(w | x)` = "`w` is true **or** `x` is true" (at a given state).  
- **Apply inner negation:** `!(w | x)` = "**not** (`w` or `x`)" ≡ "`w` is false **and** `x` is false" (neither holds).  
- **Apply next-operator:** `X !(w | x)` = "In the **next** moment, neither `w` nor `x` holds".  
- **Apply outer negation:** `!X !(w | x)` = "**It is not true** that in the next moment, neither `w` nor `x` holds".  

#### Step 3: Refine for Natural Language Clarity  
- **Literal rebuild:**  
  "It is false that (in the next moment, (it is false that (`w` or `x` holds)))."  
- **Simplify negations (logic laws):**  
  - `!X [ !(w | x) ]`  
  ≡ `!X [ w \text{ and } x \text{ both fail} ]`  
  ≡ "In the next moment, **it is not the case** that both `w` and `x` fail".  
- **Final phrasing (using implication):**  
  **"In the next moment of the system execution, at least one of `w` or `x` must hold."**  
  (Equivalently: "At the next state, `w` must be true **or** `x` must be true.")

### Key Insight  
- **Negating a negation:** `!X !φ` denies that `φ` will be false next. This forces `φ` to be true next. Here, `φ = (w | x)`.  
- **Logical equivalence:** `!X !(w | x) ≡ X (w | x)`.  
  We directly derive: **"Next, `w` or `x`"**.  
- **Why structured breakdown?**  
  Handling `!` and `X` sequentially avoids misreading (e.g., confusing `!X φ` with `X !φ`). Always resolve innermost operators first.  

**Final Translation:**  
> "In the next moment of the system execution, `w` or `x` must hold."
