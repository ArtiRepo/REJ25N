### Translation Reasoning for LTL Formula: G(a → Fb)

**Original LTL Formula:**  
G(a → Fb)

**Breakdown into Parsing Tree:**  
- Root: **G** (Globally operator)  
  - Child: **→** (Implication)  
    - Left child: **a** (atomic proposition)  
    - Right child: **F** (Finally operator)  
      - Child: **b** (atomic proposition)  

**Rebuild Meaning Bottom-Up:**  
1. **Innermost subformula (leaf):**  
   - **b**: "b holds" (at a specific moment).  
   - **Fb**: "b holds at some moment from now onward" (i.e., "eventually b holds").  

2. **Next level (implication):**  
   - **a → Fb**: "If a holds at a given moment, then eventually b holds" (starting from that same moment).  

3. **Outermost operator (global):**  
   - **G(a → Fb)**: The implication "if a holds, then eventually b holds" must be true at **every moment** in the execution.  

**Refined Natural Language Phrasing:**  
- **Literal reassembly**:  
  "Globally, if a holds, then eventually b holds."  
- **Clarity refinements**:  
  - Replace "Globally" with explicit temporal quantification: "**In every moment** of the system execution".  
  - Clarify "eventually" to emphasize temporal scope: "**from that moment onward**".  
  - Ensure implication is unambiguous: "**if a holds**" → "**then b must hold**".  
- **Final translation**:  
  **"In every moment of the system execution, if a holds, then b must hold at that moment or at some moment after it."**  

### Key Notes:
- **G** enforces the condition for **all moments** (past, present, future).  
- **Fb** includes the **current moment** or any **future moment** (non-strict future).  
- The phrasing "at that moment or at some moment after it" explicitly captures that **b may hold immediately or later**, aligning with LTL semantics.
