### Step-by-Step Reasoning for LTL Formula Translation:  
**Original LTL formula:**  
`X a & b`

---

### 1. **Breakdown into Parsing Tree**:  
The formula `X a & b` is parsed as:  
- **Syntax tree**:  
  ```
      &
     / \
    X   b
    |
    a
  ```  
- **Operator precedence**:  
  `X` (Next) has higher precedence than `&` (AND), so `X a` is evaluated first.  
- **Components**:  
  - **Left operand**: `X a` (Unary operator `X` applied to atomic proposition `a`).  
  - **Right operand**: `b` (Atomic proposition).  

---

### 2. **Rebuild Meaning from Bottom Up**:  
Start with atomic propositions and apply operators:  

- **Atomic proposition `a`**:  
  - Meaning: "`a` holds **in a given state**."  
- **Apply the `X` (Next) operator to `a`**:  
  - `X a` shifts the evaluation to the **immediately next state**.  
  - Meaning: "`a` holds **in the next moment**."  
- **Atomic proposition `b`**:  
  - Meaning: "`b` holds **in the current state**."  
- **Apply `&` (AND) to `(X a)` and `b`**:  
  - Combines the requirements:  
    - `(X a)` requires "`a` in the next state."  
    - `b` requires "`b` in the current state."  
  - Meaning: **Both** must hold simultaneously (i.e., from the perspective of the current state).  

---

### 3. **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**:  
- **Literal combination**:  
  "`b` holds in the current state, **and** `a` holds in the next state."  
- **Clarity refinements**:  
  - Explicitly anchor time references to "the current moment" and "the next moment."  
  - Use consistent terminology (e.g., "hold" for propositions, "system execution" for context).  
- **Final structured translation**:  
  > "**In the current moment of the system execution, `b` holds, and in the next moment of the system execution, `a` holds.**"  

---

### Key Insights:  
- **Operator scope**: `X` only affects `a`—**not** `b` (since `&` has lower precedence).  
- **Temporal perspective**: The formula describes properties at **two consecutive states**:  
  - `b` is evaluated **now**.  
  - `a` is evaluated **immediately after now**.  
- **No redundancy**: Avoid phrases like "should" or "must" unless the LTL formula specifies obligation (e.g., in a contract). Use neutral "holds" unless context dictates otherwise.  

✅ **Final Translation**:  
> "In the current moment of the system execution, `b` holds, and in the next moment of the system execution, `a` holds."
