### Translation of LTL Formula: **b U (a | d)**

#### 1. Original LTL Formula:
**b U (a | d)**

#### 2. Parsing Tree Breakdown:
- **Root operator:** `U` (until)  
  - **Left operand:** `b` (atomic proposition)  
  - **Right operand:** `|` (or)  
    - **Left child:** `a` (atomic proposition)  
    - **Right child:** `d` (atomic proposition)  

Tree structure:  
```
      U
    /   \
   b     |
        / \
       a   d
```

#### 3. Rebuilding Meaning from Bottom-Up:
- **Step 1 (Leaf nodes):**  
  - `a` means "`a` holds at the current moment."  
  - `d` means "`d` holds at the current moment."  
- **Step 2 (Operator `|`):**  
  - `(a | d)` means "**either `a` holds or `d` holds** (or both) at the current moment."  
- **Step 3 (Operator `U`):**  
  - `b U (a | d)` means:  
    - **There must exist a future moment** (including now) where `(a | d)` holds.  
    - **For all moments from now until *just before* that future moment, `b` must hold.**  

#### 4. Refined Natural Language Phrasing:
> "**In the system execution, either `a` or `d` must eventually hold at some moment. Until (but not including) that moment, `b` must hold continuously.**"  

#### Key Clarifications:
- **Inclusivity of "now":** If `a` or `d` holds **now**, the requirement for `b` is vacuously satisfied (no prior moments exist).  
- **Temporal scope:**  
  - `b` must hold **uninterruptedly** from the start until the moment *before* `a` or `d` becomes true.  
  - At the exact moment `a` or `d` holds, `b` **may or may not hold** (no obligation).  
- **Eventuality:** `a` or `d` **must eventually occur**; the system cannot satisfy `b` forever without `a` or `d` ever holding.  

#### Final Translation:
> "`b` must hold continuously until a moment when either `a` or `d` holds, and such a moment must eventually occur."
