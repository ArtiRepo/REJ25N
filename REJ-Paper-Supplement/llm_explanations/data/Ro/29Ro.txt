### Translation Reasoning for LTL Formula: F x | F y

**Original LTL Formula:**  
`F x | F y`

**Breakdown into Parsing Tree:**  
- Root operator: `|` (logical OR)  
  - Left subformula: `F x`  
    - Operator `F` (eventually)  
    - Atomic proposition `x`  
  - Right subformula: `F y`  
    - Operator `F` (eventually)  
    - Atomic proposition `y`  

**Tree Structure:**  
```
     | (OR)  
   /   \  
  F     F  
  |     |  
  x     y  
```

**Rebuild Meaning Bottom-Up:**  
1. **Atomic propositions (`x` and `y`):**  
   - `x` means "`x` holds in some state".  
   - `y` means "`y` holds in some state".  

2. **`F` operator (applied to `x` and `y`):**  
   - `F x` → "Eventually, `x` must hold" (i.e., `x` becomes true at least once in the future).  
   - `F y` → "Eventually, `y` must hold" (i.e., `y` becomes true at least once in the future).  

3. **`|` operator (combining `F x` and `F y`):**  
   - Disjunction of the two subformulas:  
     Either `F x` is true OR `F y` is true (or both).  
   - Meaning: "Either `x` must eventually hold, or `y` must eventually hold".  

**Refined Natural Language Phrasing:**  
- **Literal reconstruction:**  
  "In the system execution, eventually `x` holds or, in the system execution, eventually `y` holds."  
- **Clarity refinement:**  
  - Remove redundancy ("in the system execution" repeated).  
  - Emphasize disjunction ("either... or").  
  - Use obligation language ("must") to reflect LTL's requirement semantics.  
- **Final translation:**  
  **"Either `x` must eventually hold or `y` must eventually hold."**  

### Key Notes:
- `F` (eventually) implies the proposition holds **at least once** in the future, not necessarily at the same time.  
- `|` (OR) means **at least one** of the subformulas must be satisfied.  
- The phrasing avoids implying simultaneity or ordering between `x` and `y`.
