### Translation of LTL Formula: X (t & y)

**1. Original LTL Formula:**  
`X (t & y)`

**2. Parsing Tree Breakdown:**  
- Root operator: `X` (Next)  
  - Child: `&` (logical AND)  
    - Left leaf: `t` (atomic proposition)  
    - Right leaf: `y` (atomic proposition)  

**3. Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up:**  
- **Atomic propositions (`t`, `y`):**  
  - `t` means "`t` holds (is true) at the current moment".  
  - `y` means "`y` holds (is true) at the current moment".  
- **Conjunction (`t & y`):**  
  - "`t` holds **and** `y` holds" → **"Both `t` and `y` hold simultaneously at the current moment"**.  
- **Next operator (`X`):**  
  - Shifts the focus to the **immediately following moment** in the system execution.  
  - Applies to the entire conjunction `(t & y)`.  
  → **"In the next moment, both `t` and `y` must hold"**.  

**4. Refined Natural Language Phrasing:**  
> "In the next moment of the system execution, `t` must hold and `y` must hold."  

### Key Reasoning Summary:  
- **Operator precedence:** `X` applies to the entire expression `(t & y)`, not individually to `t` or `y` (unlike `X t & X y`).  
- **Temporal focus:** `X` shifts the evaluation **one step forward** in time.  
- **Conjunction requirement:** Both `t` and `y` must be true **at that same next moment**.  
- **Clarity refinement:** Explicitly state "must hold" for both propositions to emphasize necessity and simultaneity.  

*Final translation: "In the next moment of the system execution, `t` must hold and `y` must hold."*
