### Translation Reasoning for LTL Formula: X (t | w)

#### Original LTL Formula:
X (t | w)

#### Parsing Tree Breakdown:
- **Root operator**: `X` (Next)  
  - **Child**: `(t | w)` (Disjunction)  
    - **Left leaf**: `t` (atomic proposition)  
    - **Right leaf**: `w` (atomic proposition)  

#### Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up:
1. **Atomic propositions**:  
   - `t` means "`t` holds" (at a given moment).  
   - `w` means "`w` holds" (at a given moment).  
2. **Disjunction (`t | w`)**:  
   - "Either `t` holds or `w` holds" (at the same moment).  
3. **Next operator (`X`)**:  
   - Applies to the entire disjunction `(t | w)`.  
   - "In the **next moment** of the system execution, [meaning of `(t | w)`]."  

#### Refined Natural Language Phrasing:
- **Combined meaning**:  
  "In the next moment of the system execution, either `t` holds or `w` holds."  
- **Clarity refinement**:  
  Replace technical terms ("holds") with simpler phrasing if needed:  
  **Final translation**:  
  > "In the next state, either `t` is true or `w` is true."  

#### Key Insight:
- The `X` operator **scopes over the entire disjunction** `(t | w)`, so the disjunction is evaluated **strictly at the next moment**.  
- Contrast with `(X t) | (X w)` (which would allow `t`/`w` to be true in different future states). Here, both must be evaluated **simultaneously in the immediate next state**.
