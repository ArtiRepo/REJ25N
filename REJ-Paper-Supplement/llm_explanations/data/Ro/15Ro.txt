### Translation Reasoning for LTL Formula: G a

#### Original LTL Formula:
G a

#### Parsing Tree Breakdown:
```
     G    (Global operator)
      |
      a   (Atomic proposition)
```

#### Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up:
1. **Atomic proposition `a`**:  
   Represents a state property. Base meaning:  
   → *"a holds"* (or *"a is true"*).

2. **Unary operator `G` (Globally)**:  
   Applies to its subformula (`a`). Semantics:  
   → *"At every moment in the system execution, the subformula must hold"*.

3. **Combine `G` with `a`**:  
   Substitute the meaning of `a` into `G`:  
   → *"At every moment in the system execution, a must hold"*.

#### Refined Natural Language Phrasing:
- **Initial combination**:  
  "At every moment in the system execution, a must hold."  
- **Clarity refinements**:  
  - Replace "At every moment" with "**In every moment**" for fluency.  
  - Specify "**from now onward**" to emphasize temporal scope (implied by LTL semantics).  
  - Use "**has to hold**" for consistency with the example.  

**Final Translation**:  
"G a means that **in every moment of the system execution (from now onward), a has to hold**."  

#### Key Reasoning Summary:
- `a` is a base state condition.  
- `G` scopes this condition over **all future states** in the execution path.  
- No intermediate steps needed (unlike operators with multiple subformulas).  
- Refinement focuses on natural flow and explicit temporal scope.
