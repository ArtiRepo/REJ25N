### Reasoning for LTL Formula Translation: `a U G!a`

#### Step 1: Original LTL Formula  
`a U G!a`  
(Note: Read as `a` *Until* `G!a`)

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
- **Root operator**: `U` (Until)  
  - **Left child**: atomic proposition `a`  
  - **Right child**: `G!a` (Globally/Always not-`a`)  
    - **Child operator**: `G` (Globally/Always)  
      - **Child operator**: `!` (Not)  
        - **Leaf**: atomic proposition `a`  

#### Step 3: Rebuild Meaning from Bottom-Up  
1. **Innermost (`a`)**:  
   - `a` means "`a` holds **at a specific moment**."  
2. **Negation (`!a`)**:  
   - `!a` means "`a` does **not** hold at a specific moment."  
3. **Globally (`G!a`)**:  
   - `G!a` means "From a certain moment onward, `a` **never** holds."  
   (i.e., "`a` is **permanently false** starting from some future state.")  
4. **Until (`a U G!a`)**:  
   - `a U G!a` means:  
     - `a` must hold **continuously** from now until **just before** the moment when `G!a` begins.  
     - At the **exact moment** when `G!a` starts, `a` **stops holding** (as `G!a` requires `!a`), marking the start of permanent `!a`.  

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Translation  
**Concise phrasing**:  
- "`a` holds **continuously until the system reaches a state where `a` becomes and remains false forever**."  

**Key clarifications**:  
- **Continuity**: `a` must hold **without interruption** from now until the transition to permanent `!a`.  
- **Transition point**: At the moment `G!a` starts:  
  - `a` is **false** (by definition of `G!a`).  
  - The `U` operator **stops requiring `a`** at this exact moment (only `G!a` matters here).  
- **Edge cases**:  
  - If `a` is **already permanently false** now (i.e., `G!a` holds immediately), the `U` is vacuously satisfied (no `a` is required before time 0).  
  - Otherwise, `a` must hold **finitely many times** before transitioning to permanent `!a`.  

**Why this works**:  
- No contradiction: The `U` requires `a` only *before* the start of `G!a` (where `a` must hold), while at the start of `G!a`, `!a` is enforced.  
- Example: Sequences like `[a, a, a, !a, !a, ...]` satisfy this, but `[a, !a, a, !a, ...]` does not (due to interruption before permanent `!a`).  

**Final Translation**:  
> "`a` must hold continuously until the system reaches a state from which `a` becomes and remains false forever."
