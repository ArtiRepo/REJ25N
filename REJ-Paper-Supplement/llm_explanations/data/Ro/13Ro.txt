### Translation of LTL Formula: (c U a) & (b U a)

#### Step 1: Original LTL Formula  
\( (c \, \mathcal{U} \, a) \land (b \, \mathcal{U} \, a) \)

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
The formula is a conjunction (`&`) of two subformulas:  
- **Left subformula**: \( c \, \mathcal{U} \, a \) (until operator with operands `c` and `a`).  
- **Right subformula**: \( b \, \mathcal{U} \, a \) (until operator with operands `b` and `a`).  

Parsing tree structure:  
```
&  
|  
├── U (left)  
│   ├── c (predicate)  
│   └── a (predicate)  
└── U (right)  
    ├── b (predicate)  
    └── a (predicate)
```

#### Step 3: Rebuild Meaning from Atomic Propositions  
1. **Atomic propositions**:  
   - `a`, `b`, `c` are atomic propositions (e.g., "event `a` occurs", "property `b` is true").  

2. **Interpret subformulas bottom-up**:  
   - Left subformula \( c \, \mathcal{U} \, a \):  
     - Standard LTL semantics for \( \mathcal{U} \): "There exists a future state where `a` holds, and for all states up to (but not including) that state, `c` holds."  
     - Natural language: "**Eventually at some moment \( t \), `a` occurs, and `c` holds continuously from now until just before \( t \).**"  
   - Right subformula \( b \, \mathcal{U} \, a \):  
     - Similarly: "**Eventually at some moment \( s \), `a` occurs, and `b` holds continuously from now until just before \( s \).**"  

3. **Combine with conjunction (`&`)**:  
   - Both subformulas must hold in the execution path.  
   - Key nuance: The moments \( t \) and \( s \) (when `a` occurs) **may be the same or different**.  

#### Step 4: Refine Natural Language for Clarity  
- **Refined translation**:  
  > "Eventually, `a` occurs at some moment, and until that moment `c` holds continuously; **and separately**, eventually `a` occurs at some moment (possibly the same or a later moment), and until that moment `b` holds continuously."  

- **Clarifications**:  
  - **Continuity**: For each until subformula, the operand (`c` or `b`) must hold in **every state** from the current state up to the instant **before** `a` occurs.  
  - **Independence of events**: The two occurrences of `a` are not required to coincide. For example:  
    - If `a` occurs at time \( t \), `c` holds until \( t \).  
    - If `a` occurs again at a later time \( s \), `b` must hold until \( s \) (and if \( t < s \), `b` must also hold between \( t \) and \( s \)).  
  - If `a` holds now (current state), both subformulas are immediately satisfied (the "until" intervals are vacuously true as there are no preceding states).  

### Final Natural Language Translation  
> **"The system will eventually reach a state where `a` holds, and until then `c` must hold continuously; and independently, it will eventually reach a state where `a` holds (which may be the same state or a later one), and until then `b` must hold continuously."**  

This captures the independent nature of the two until conditions while emphasizing continuity requirements and the possible separation of `a` events.
