### Translation of LTL Formula: **X(!g | !j)**

#### 1. **Original LTL Formula**  
   `X(!g | !j)`

---

#### 2. **Parse Tree Breakdown**  
The formula is parsed as follows:  
```
      X  
      |  
    ( | )  
    /   \  
  !      !  
  |      |  
  g      j  
```
- **Leaves** (atomic propositions):  
  - `g` (atomic proposition "g")  
  - `j` (atomic proposition "j")  
- **Operators**:  
  - `!` (negation) applied to `g` and `j`.  
  - `|` (disjunction, OR) combining `!g` and `!j`.  
  - `X` (temporal "Next" operator) applied to the disjunction.  

---

#### 3. **Rebuilding Meaning (Bottom-Up)**  
- **Step 1: Interpret leaves**  
  - `g` means "`g` holds (is true)."  
  - `j` means "`j` holds (is true)."  

- **Step 2: Apply negations** (~80 words runtime applied first):  
  - `!g` means "`g` does **not** hold."  
  - `!j` means "`j` does **not** hold."  

- **Step 3: Apply disjunction (|)**  
  - `(!g | !j)` means:  
    *"`g` does not hold **OR** `j` does not hold."*  
    *(This includes cases where both are false).*  

- **Step 4: Apply "Next" (X)**  
  - `X(!g | !j)` means:  
    *"In the **next moment** of execution, `g` does not hold OR `j` does not hold."*  

---

#### 4. **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**  
To enhance clarity and conciseness:  
- Use **temporal framing** for `X`: Explicitly anchor to "the next system state."  
- **Simplify logic**: The disjunction `!g | !j` is equivalent to "at least one of `g` or `j` is false."  
- **Final translation**:  
  > *"In the next moment of system execution, either `g` is false or `j` is false (or both)."*  

#### Key Notes:  
- The `X` operator applies to the **entire disjunction**, so the same "next moment" governs both `g` and `j`.  
- Alternative phrasing (via De Morgan’s Law):  
  *"In the next moment, it is **not** the case that both `g` and `j` hold."*  
  (Both are semantically equivalent but use distinct logical emphasis.)
