### Translation of LTL Formula: `a U c`

**Original LTL Formula**:  
`a U c`

**Parsing Tree Breakdown**:  
- Operator: `U` (Until)  
- Left operand: `a` (atomic proposition)  
- Right operand: `c` (atomic proposition)  

Tree structure:  
```
     U  
    / \  
   a   c  
```

**Rebuilding Meaning from Bottom Up**:  
1. **Atomic propositions**:  
   - `a` means "`a` holds at the current moment."  
   - `c` means "`c` holds at the current moment."  

2. **Operator `U` semantics**:  
   - `P U Q` requires:  
     - `Q` must hold **at some future moment** (including now).  
     - `P` must hold **continuously** from the current moment **until** (and not including) the moment `Q` holds.  

**Refined Natural Language Phrasing**:  
> "Property `a` must hold continuously **until** property `c` becomes true, and `c` **must eventually hold** at some future moment."  

**Key Clarifications**:  
- **Continuity**: `a` must hold at every step starting now, without gaps, until `c` becomes true.  
- **Eventuality**: `c` **must** occur at least once in the future (failure if `c` never holds).  
- **Inclusion of present**: If `c` holds now, `a` is not required for prior steps (trivially satisfied).  

**Example**:  
- Valid execution: `[a, a, a, c, ...]` (a holds until c at step 3).  
- Invalid execution: `[a, ¬a, c, ...]` (a breaks before c).  
- Invalid execution: `[a, a, a, ...]` (c never holds).
