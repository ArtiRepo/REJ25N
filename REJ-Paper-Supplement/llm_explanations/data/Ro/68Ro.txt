### Translation Reasoning for LTL Formula: `a U b`

**Original LTL Formula:**  
`a U b` (where `U` is the "Until" operator)

---

#### Step 1: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
- **Operator**: `U` (Until)  
  - **Left operand**: `a` (atomic proposition)  
  - **Right operand**: `b` (atomic proposition)  

```
     U
    / \
   a   b
```

---

#### Step 2: Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up  
1. **Atomic propositions**:  
   - `a` means "`a` holds at the current moment."  
   - `b` means "`b` holds at the current moment."  
   *(Note: Temporal operators extend this to future moments.)*  

2. **Operator `U` semantics**:  
   - `a U b` requires:  
     - **Existence of `b`**: There **must exist a future moment** (possibly now) where `b` holds.  
     - **Continuity of `a`**: From the **current moment until (but not necessarily including)** the moment `b` holds, `a` must hold at **every intermediate moment**.  

---

#### Step 3: Refined Natural Language Phrasing  
- **Direct translation**:  
  "`a` must hold continuously until `b` holds, and `b` must eventually hold."  

- **Clarity refinements**:  
  - Explicitly state **temporal continuity** ("continuously until").  
  - Emphasize **eventuality** ("must eventually hold").  
  - Clarify **exclusion of the `b`-moment** for `a` (if `b` holds now, `a` is not required at all).  

**Final Structured Translation**:  
> "The system must satisfy `a` continuously until the moment when `b` becomes true, and `b` must eventually become true."  

---

#### Key Notes:  
- **Why "continuously"?** Ensures `a` holds at **every step** between now and the `b`-moment.  
- **Why "eventually"?** The `U` operator mandates `b` **must occur** (liveness property).  
- **Edge case**: If `b` holds now, `a` is irrelevant (no intermediate moments).  
- Contrast with `X` (next): `U` spans **multiple future moments**, not just the immediate next.
