**Original LTL Formula:**  
`t => w`  

**Parsing Tree Breakdown:**  
1. **Root node:** Implication operator (`=>`).  
2. **Left child:** Atomic proposition `t` (represents a condition at the **current moment**).  
3. **Right child:** Atomic proposition `w` (represents another condition at the **current moment**).  

**Rebuilding Meaning (Bottom-Up):**  
- **Step 1 (Atomic propositions):**  
  - `t` means: *"t holds at the current moment."*  
  - `w` means: *"w holds at the current moment."*  
- **Step 2 (Implication operator `=>`):**  
  - Combine the meaning: *"Whenever `t` holds at the current moment, `w` must also hold at the current moment."*  

**Refined Natural Language Phrasing:**  
To align with the system-execution context (like the example) and ensure clarity:  
> *"At the current moment of the system execution, if t holds, then w must hold."*  

### Key Reasoning:  
1. **No temporal operators (e.g., `X`, `G`, `F`):**  
   Both `t` and `w` refer strictly to the **current state** (no future/past states involved).  
2. **Implication semantics:**  
   `t => w` is equivalent to *"t being true forces w to be true at the same moment."*  
3. **Clarity adjustments:**  
   - Specify *"current moment"* to anchor the evaluation time (like *"next moment"* in the example).  
   - Use *"must hold"* to convey necessity (matching the example’s tone).  
   - Omit redundant phrases for conciseness (e.g., avoiding double *"in the next moment"* repetitions).  

**Final Translation:**  
> **"At the current moment of the system execution, if t holds, then w must hold."**
