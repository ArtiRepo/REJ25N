### Step-by-Step Translation of LTL Formula: **G(a→b)**  
*(Following the requested structure)*  

---

#### 1. **Original LTL Formula**  
`G(a→b)`  

---

#### 2. **Parsing Tree Breakdown**  
- Top operator: **`G`** (Globally/Always)  
  - Operand: **Implication `(a→b)`**  
    - Left child: **Atomic proposition `a`**  
    - Right child: **Atomic proposition `b`**  
```
    G  
    |  
    →  
   / \  
  a   b  
```

#### 3. **Rebuild Meaning from Bottom-Up**  
Start with atomic propositions:  
- `a`: "`a` holds."  
- `b`: "`b` holds."  

Build **implication **`(a→b)`**:  
- **Meaning**: "*If `a` holds, then `b` must hold*" (**at the same moment in time**).  

Apply the **`G` operator**:  
- `G` imposes the requirement on **all moments** in the execution:  
  - **Meaning**: "*The implication `(a→b)` must hold* ***at every moment*** *of the system execution.*"  

Combine:  
- "***In every moment of the execution, if `a` holds at that moment, then `b` must hold at that same moment.***"  

---

#### 4. **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**  
- **Concise version**:  
  > "*Globally, whenever `a` is true, `b` must be true.*"  

- **Verbose/clarified version**:  
  > "***Throughout the entire system execution, at every moment where proposition `a` holds, proposition `b` must also hold at that same moment.***"  

- **Alternative intuitive phrasing**:  
  > "*`a` is never true unless `b` is true at the same time, and this holds forever.*"  

---

**Key Insight**:  
- `G` forces the condition `(a→b)` (same-time implication) to hold **continuously** during execution.  
- `→` is evaluated **instantaneously** (same time point), unlike operators like `U` (Until) that span time intervals.  

*Final Translation*:  
**"At every moment in the execution, if a holds then b must hold."**  
*(Matches the example format)*
