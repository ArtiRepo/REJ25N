### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Translating LTL Formula `F (!y & w)`

#### 1. **Original LTL Formula**  
   `F (!y & w)`  

---

#### 2. **Breakdown into a Parsing Tree**  
We decompose the formula from the outermost operator inward:  
- **Top operator:** `F` ("eventually")  
  - **Argument:** `(!y & w)` (a conjunction)  
    - **Sub-components of the conjunction:**  
      - **Left operand:** `!y` (negation)  
        - **Argument:** Atomic proposition `y`  
      - **Right operand:** Atomic proposition `w`  

**Visual Tree Structure:**  
```
      F        (Eventually)
      |
      &        (And)
     /   \
    !     w    (Not)  
    |           |
    y          (y)  
```

#### 3. **Rebuild Meaning from the Bottom Up**  
Start with atomic propositions and recursively apply operators:  
1. **`y`**: "`y` holds."  
2. **`!y`**: Negation of `y` → "`y` does **not** hold."  
3. **`w`**: "`w` holds."  
4. **`!y & w`**: Conjunction of `!y` and `w` → "`y` does not hold **and** `w` holds."  
5. **`F (!y & w)`**: Apply `F` to the conjunction →  
   "*Eventually*, `y` does not hold **and** `w` holds."  

---

#### 4. **Refine Phrasing for Clarity**  
- **Initial direct translation:**  
  "Eventually, `y` does not hold and `w` holds."  
- **Improvements for clarity/naturalness:**  
  - Clarify "holds" → "is true."  
  - Specify simultaneity (both conditions at the **same future moment**).  
  - Use natural temporal phrasing.  

**Final Translation:**  
> **"Eventually, at some future moment, `y` is false and `w` is true simultaneously."**  

#### Key Notes:  
- **`F` (Eventually)**: Ensures the condition `!y & w` occurs at **least once** in the future.  
- **Conjunction `&`**: Both `!y` and `w` must be true **at the same future state**.  
- **Negation `!`**: Explicitly marks the absence of `y`.  
- **No operators are "split"** (e.g., `F !y & F w` would mean each condition could occur at *different* times; here they **must coincide**).
