### Reasoning for Translation of LTL Formula: **(c & b) U a**

#### Step 1: Original LTL Formula  
`(c & b) U a`

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
The formula has a **top-level operator "U" (Until)**, with two subformulas:  
- **Left operand**: `(c & b)` (a conjunction)  
- **Right operand**: `a` (an atomic proposition)  

The conjunction `(c & b)` breaks down further:  
- **Left leaf**: `c`  
- **Right leaf**: `b`  

**Parsing Tree**:  
```
      U  
     / \  
    &   a  
   / \  
  c   b  
```

#### Step 3: Rebuild Meaning Bottom-Up  
1. **Atomic propositions (leaves)**:  
   - `c` means "`c` holds (at the current moment)".  
   - `b` means "`b` holds (at the current moment)".  

2. **Conjunction `(c & b)`**:  
   - Combines `c` and `b`: "**both `c` and `b` hold** (simultaneously at the current moment)".  

3. **Until operator `(c & b) U a`**:  
   - The `U` operator has two parts:  
     - **Left part (`(c & b)`)** must hold **continuously** until...  
     - **Right part (`a`)** becomes true **at some future moment**.  
   - Semantics:  
     - There must exist a **future moment** where `a` holds.  
     - **Until that future moment**, `(c & b)` must hold **at every moment** (starting from now).  
     - At the **exact moment** `a` holds, `(c & b)` may or may not hold (it is not required).  

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Phrasing  
- **Literal rebuild**:  
  > "There exists a future moment where `a` holds, and at every moment until then, both `c` and `b` hold."  

- **Refined for clarity and conciseness**:  
  > "**Eventually, `a` must hold, and until then, both `c` and `b` must hold continuously.**"  

#### Final Translation  
`(c & b) U a` means:  
**"Eventually, `a` must hold, and until then, both `c` and `b` must hold continuously."**  

### Key Notes  
- **"Until then"** implies `(c & b)` holds at **every step** from the current moment up to (but not necessarily including) the moment `a` holds.  
- If `a` holds **immediately**, `(c & b)` is not required (the "until" condition is vacuously true).  
- The translation emphasizes **continuity** of `(c & b)` until the eventual occurrence of `a`.
