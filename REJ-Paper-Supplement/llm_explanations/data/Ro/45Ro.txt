### Reasoned Translation of the LTL Formula: X (!i) | X (j)

#### Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula  
**Original formula:** \( \text{X }(\neg i) \lor \text{X }(j) \)  
*(This can also be written as \( \text{X }\neg i \lor \text{X } j \))*

---

#### Step 2: Break the formula into a parsing tree (breakdown)  
The parsing tree decomposes the formula hierarchically:  
- **Top-level operator:** Disjunction (\(\lor\)), which joins two subformulas:  
  - **Left operand:** \(\text{X }(\neg i)\)  
    - *Operator:* Next (\(\text{X}\)) applied to a subformula \(\neg i\).  
    - *Subformula:* \(\neg i\)  
      - *Operator:* Negation (\(\neg\)) applied to \(i\).  
      - *Atom:* \(i\) (atomic proposition).  
  - **Right operand:** \(\text{X }(j)\)  
    - *Operator:* Next (\(\text{X}\)) applied to a subformula.  
    - *Subformula:* \(j\) (atomic proposition).  

**Visual tree representation:**  
```
    OR (∨)  
   /     \  
  X       X  
  |       |  
  ¬       j  
  |  
  i
```

---

#### Step 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up  
1. **Atoms (leaves):**  
   - \(i\): "`i` holds" at the current moment.  
   - \(\neg i\): "`i` **does not hold**" at the current moment.  
   - \(j\): "`j` holds" at the current moment.  

2. **Next operators (\(\text{X}\)):**  
   - \(\text{X }(\neg i)\): **"In the next moment, `i` does not hold."**  
     (Applies \(\neg i\) to the immediate next state.)  
   - \(\text{X }(j)\): **"In the next moment, `j` has to hold."**  
     (Applies \(j\) to the immediate next state.)  

3. **Disjunction (\(\lor\)):**  
   - Combines the two \(\text{X}\)-subformulas:  
     *"Either **[left subformula]** OR **[right subformula]**, i.e.,  
     **Either in the next moment, `i` does not hold, OR in the next moment, `j` has to hold."***  

---

#### Step 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity  
- **Initial phrasing:** "Either in the next moment, `i` does not hold, OR in the next moment, `j` has to hold."  
- **Key refinements:**  
  1. **Clarify temporal alignment:** Both \(\text{X}\)-operators refer to the **same next moment**, so use "**in the next moment**" once for cohesion.  
  2. **Emphasize disjunction:** Use parallel structure "**either...or...**" to highlight the choice.  
  3. **Precision:** Use "**has to hold**" for positive obligations (like the example) and "**does not hold**" for negations.  

**Final structured NL translation:**  
> **"Either in the next moment of the system execution, `i` should not hold or `j` has to hold."**  

*Explanation of refinements:*  
- **"In the next moment of the system execution"** standardizes the temporal context.  
- **"`i` should not hold"** mirrors \(\neg i\) (negation).  
- **"`j` has to hold"** parallels "f has to hold" in the example (positive obligation).  
- **"Either...or"** cleanly captures the disjunction (\(\lor\)) without ambiguity.  

---

### Summary  
- **Key insight:** The formula is a disjunction of two \(\text{X}\)-operations that **share the same next state**.  
- **Intuition:** At the immediate next moment, the system avoids property violation by ensuring either:  
  - `i` is absent, OR  
  - `j` is present (or both).
