### Translation Reasoning for LTL Formula: `FGa`

**1. Original LTL Formula:**  
`FGa` (equivalent to `F(G a)`).

**2. Parsing Tree Breakdown:**  
- **Leaf (atomic proposition):** `a`  
  *Meaning: Property `a` holds in a state.*  
- **First operator application:** `G a`  
  *Meaning: "Globally `a`" – `a` holds in **all future states** from some point onward.*  
- **Outermost operator application:** `F(G a)`  
  *Meaning: "Finally `(G a)`" – `G a` must hold at **some future state**.*  

**3. Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up:**  
- Start with `a`:  
  "`a` holds in a specific state."  
- Apply `G` to `a`:  
  "`a` holds **continuously forever** starting from some state `s`."  
  *(i.e., from state `s` onward, `a` is always true)*  
- Apply `F` to `(G a)`:  
  "There **exists a future state** `s` where `(G a)` becomes true."  
  *(i.e., at state `s`, `a` starts holding and **never stops**)*  

**4. Refined Natural Language Phrasing:**  
> "**Eventually, `a` becomes permanently true.**"  

### Key Insights:
- `G a` requires **persistent truth**: Once `a` holds, it *must hold forever after*.  
- `F` shifts focus to **future fulfillment**: This persistence must start *at some point*.  
- Combined: `a` may be false initially, but from *some future state onward*, it becomes **always true**.  

*(Example: "Eventually the system enters a safe mode and never exits.")*
