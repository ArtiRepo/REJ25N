**Original LTL formula:**  
a U (b & c)  

**Parsing tree breakdown:**  
```
     U  
    / \  
   a   &  
      / \  
     b   c  
```  
- **Leaves**: Atomic propositions `a`, `b`, `c` (basic state properties).  
- **First composition**: `b & c` (a conjunction meaning both `b` and `c` must hold simultaneously).  
- **Root**: `U` (the "Until" operator connecting `a` and `(b & c)`).  

**Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up:**  
1. **`b & c`**:  
   - "At some moment in the execution, both `b` and `c` must be true **at the same time**."  
2. **`a U (b & c)`**:  
   - Combines the requirement above with `a` using `U`:  
     - The `U` operator demands:  
       - **Eventuality**: The state `(b & c)` (from step 1) must eventually occur.  
       - **Continuity**: At every moment **from now** until **immediately before** `(b & c)` occurs, `a` must hold.  
     - Example cases:  
       - If `(b & c)` holds **now**, `a` is not required at any moment (vacuously satisfied).  
       - If `(b & c)` holds in the **future**, `a` must hold **now and continuously** until the step just before `(b & c)`.  

**Refined natural language phrasing for clarity:**  
> "The system must eventually reach a state where both `b` and `c` are true at the same time. Until that state is reached (if it has not already occurred), `a` must hold **continuously from the current moment onward**."  

### Key Notes:
- **Eventuality**: `(b & c)` must happen at least once (strong guarantee).  
- **Continuity**: `a` covers all states strictly **between now** and the moment `(b & c)` happens (excludes the `(b & c)` state itself).  
- **Edge case**: If `(b & c)` is true now, no `a` is required.
