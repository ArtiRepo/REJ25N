### Step-by-Step Reasoning for LTL Formula: `a & X b`

1. **Original LTL Formula**:  
   `a & X b`

2. **Parsing Tree Breakdown**:  
   - Root operator: `&` (logical AND)  
     - Left child: Atomic proposition `a`  
     - Right child: Unary operator `X` (Next)  
       - Child of `X`: Atomic proposition `b`  

   ```
      &
     / \
    a   X
        |
        b
   ```

3. **Rebuild Meaning Bottom-Up**:  
   - **Atomic proposition `b`** (leaf):  
     `b` is a condition that must hold at some time point.  
   - **`X b` (Next operator)**:  
     "`b` must hold **in the next moment** (i.e., the immediate future state)."  
   - **Atomic proposition `a` (leaf)**:  
     `a` is a condition that must hold at some time point.  
   - **`a & X b` (Conjunction)**:  
     Combine the meaning of `a` (applies to the **current moment**) and `X b` (applies to the **next moment**).  
     → "**At the current moment**, `a` must hold, **AND** in the **next moment**, `b` must hold."  

4. **Refine Phrasing for Clarity**:  
   - Explicitly specify temporal references (avoid ambiguity about "current" vs. "next").  
   - Use natural language parallel to the parsing tree structure.  
   - **Final Translation**:  
     **"`a` holds at the current moment of the system execution, and in the next moment of the system execution, `b` holds."**  

### Key Insights:
- **Atomic propositions** (`a`, `b`) represent state conditions (e.g., "the system is in a safe mode").  
- **`X` (Next)** shifts the focus to the **immediately following state** in the execution trace.  
- **`&` (AND)** combines requirements about **different time points**:  
  - `a` constraints the **current state**.  
  - `X b` constraints the **directly subsequent state**.  

This approach ensures precise temporal logic→English translation by recursively interpreting operators from leaves to the root.
