### Translation of LTL Formula: `G(a and !b)`

#### Step 1: Original LTL Formula  
`G(a and !b)`

---

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
Break down operators/subformulas hierarchically:  
1. **Atomic propositions** (leaf nodes):  
   - `a`  
   - `b`  
2. **Negation (`!`)**:  
   - Applies to `b` → `!b` means "**b does not hold**".  
3. **Conjunction (`and`)**::  
   - Combines `a` and `!b` → `a and !b` means "**a holds and b does not hold**".  
4. **Global (`G`)**::  
   - Applies to `a and !b` → `G(a and !b)` means "**Globally, (a holds and b does not hold)**".  

Parsing Tree:  
```
     G  
     |  
    and  
   /   \  
  a     !  
        |  
        b  
```

#### Step 3: Rebuild Meaning Bottom-Up  
- **Step 3.1 (Leaf nodes)**:  
  - `b`: "**b holds**".  
  - `a`: "**a holds**".  
- **Step 3.2 (Apply `!` to `b`)**:  
  - `!b`: "**b does not hold**" (negation flips meaning).  
- **Step 3.3 (Apply `and` to `a` and `!b`)**:  
  - `a and !b`: "**a holds and b does not hold**" (both conditions at the **same moment**).  
- **Step 3.4 (Apply `G` globally)**:  
  - `G(a and !b)`: "**At every moment** (globally), **a holds and b does not hold**".  

---

#### Step 4: Refine Natural Language Phrasing  
- **Initial phrasing** (literal):  
  > "In every moment, a holds and b does not hold."  
- **Refinements for clarity/naturalness**:  
  - Replace technical jargon: "holds" → **"is true"** or **"holds"** (retained for consistency with the example).  
  - Emphasize temporal scope: "**At every moment**" → **"Throughout the entire execution"** to align with `G` (global).  
  - Use obligation language: **"must hold"** (positive) and **"must not hold"** (negative) for requirements-style phrasing.  
  - Remove redundancy: The original conjunction groups conditions per moment. Avoid repeating "in every moment" (unlike the example which reused "next moment" due to `X` over two clauses).  

**Final translation**:  
> "**Throughout the entire system execution, a must hold and b must not hold.**"  

#### Optional Enhanced Variant  
To mirror the example’s verbatim style (though less concise):  
> "Globally, a has to hold and, globally, b should not hold."  
*(Less preferred: repeats "globally" unnecessarily).*

### Key Insights  
- **`G` (Global)** demands a condition **at every single moment**—unlike `X` (next moment) in the example.  
- **`and`** forces **simultaneous conditions** (both true at the same time).  
- Refinement prioritizes conciseness, natural flow, and requirements language ("must").  
- Ultimate translation: **`Gφ` ≡ "Always φ"**, with `φ = a ∧ ¬b` → φ is always true.
