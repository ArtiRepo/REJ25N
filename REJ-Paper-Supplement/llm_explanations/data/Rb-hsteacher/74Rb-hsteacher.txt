### Translation of LTL Formula: **G(a ∨ b)**

#### Step 1: Original LTL Formula  
`G(a or b)`  
*(Globally, `a` or `b`)*  

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
The formula has a hierarchical structure:  
```
      G     (Global operator)
       |
      ∨     (Disjunction: "or")
      / \
     a   b  (Atomic propositions)
```  
- **Leaves**:  
  - `a`: Atomic proposition (e.g., "Door is closed").  
  - `b`: Atomic proposition (e.g., "Alarm is active").  
- **First Composition**:  
  `(a ∨ b)` means "**`a` holds *or* `b` holds**" at a given time.  
- **Outmost Operator**:  
  `G` applies to `(a ∨ b)`, meaning "**globally**"—i.e., over *all future states*.  

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up  
1. **Atomic Propositions**:  
   - `a` is true if condition `a` holds at a specific time.  
   - `b` is true if condition `b` holds at that same time.  
2. **Disjunction (a ∨ b)**:  
   - Satisfied if **at least one** of `a` or `b` holds at a given state.  
   - *Constraint*: Never both false simultaneously.  
3. **Global Operator (G)**:  
   - Applies `(a ∨ b)` to **every state** from now to infinity.  
   - *Constraint*: At **no future point** can `a` *and* `b` *both* be false.  

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Translation  
> **"Always, at least one of `a` or `b` is true."**  

##### Key Explanations:  
- **When satisfied?**:  
  The system must **continuously satisfy** `(a ∨ b)` across all future states.  
  - *Valid traces*:  
    - `a` always true; `b` irrelevant.  
    - `b` always true; `a` irrelevant.  
    - Alternating between `a` and `b` (but **never both false**).  
- **Constraints imposed**:  
  - The system is **forbidden** from entering any state where **both `a` and `b` are false**.  
  - Even if `a`/`b` change over time, one must always be active.  
- **Practical Example** (for intuition):  
  > *"Eternally, the door must be closed OR the alarm must be active.  
  > The system is faulty if both ever become false simultaneously."*  

##### Common Pitfalls:  
- ❌ `G(a) ∨ G(b)` (Always-`a` OR always-`b`): ≠ `G(a ∨ b)`.  
- ✅ **Weaker requirement**: Only one of `a`/`b` needs to hold at any time—not forever.  

**Final Translation**:  
> **"At every future moment, proposition `a` is true or proposition `b` is true (or both)."**
