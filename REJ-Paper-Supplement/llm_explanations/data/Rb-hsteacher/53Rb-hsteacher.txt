### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Translating the LTL Formula: **Fa → Gb**

#### Step 1: Write down the original LTL formula  
**Fa → Gb**

---

#### Step 2: Break the formula into a parsing tree  
The formula is a logical **implication** (`→`) with two subformulas:  
- **Left subformula**: `Fa` (where `F` is the **eventually** operator, and `a` is an atomic proposition).  
- **Right subformula**: `Gb` (where `G` is the **globally** operator, and `b` is an atomic proposition).  

**Parsing Tree**:  
```
      →
     / \
    F   G
    |   |
    a   b
```

#### Step 3: Rebuild meaning from the bottom up  
1. **Atomic propositions**:  
   - `a`: "Proposition `a` is true **at a specific time**."  
   - `b`: "Proposition `b` is true **at a specific time**."  

2. **Subformula `Fa` (Eventually `a`)**:  
   - Meaning: "At some future time (possibly now), `a` **becomes true**."  
   - Formal Semantics: `Fa` is satisfied if there exists **at least one time** in the future where `a` holds.  

3. **Subformula `Gb` (Globally `b`)**:  
   - Meaning: "From **now onward, `b` is true for all future times."  
   - Formal Semantics: `Gb` requires `b` to hold at **every moment** starting from the current time, indefinitely.  

4. **Implication `Fa → Gb`**:  
   - Logical structure: **"If `Fa` is true, then `Gb` must also be true."**  
   - Key implications:  
     - If `a` **ever** becomes true in the future (i.e., `Fa` holds), then `b` **must be true continuously from now onward** (i.e., `Gb` holds).  
     - If `a` **never** becomes true (`Fa` is false), the formula is **automatically satisfied** (no constraints on `b`).  
   - **Timeline Constraint**: The requirement for `Gb` (global truth of `b`) is **triggered solely** by the occurrence of `a` in the future. Once `a` occurs, `b` must hold **from that point backward to the start and forward forever** (i.e., retroactive and perpetual).  

---

#### Step 4: Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity  
- **Initial translation**:  
  > "If eventually `a` happens, then `b` must always hold."  

- **Problems with initial phrasing**:  
  - Ambiguity about "always": Does it start *now* or only *after* `a` happens?  
  - Omits the retroactive requirement: If `a` occurs at time **t**, `b` must have held **since time 0** and continue beyond **t**.  

- **Refined phrasing**:  
  > **"If `a` eventually becomes true at any future time, then `b` must hold continuously *from the very beginning* (now) and *for all future time*."**  

- **Alternative (for case emphasis)**:  
  > **"Either `a` never happens, or `b` is true at every moment from now onward."**  

---

### Final Translation  
The LTL formula **Fa → Gb** means:  
> **"The occurrence of `a` at any future time requires `b` to be true at every moment, starting from the initial state and continuing indefinitely."**  

#### Key Takeaways for Students  
- **Triggering Condition**: The formula constrains the system **only if `a` occurs**. If `a` never occurs, the system is free to behave arbitrarily.  
- **Global Constraint**: If `a` occurs, `b` must be **eternally true from the start** (not just during/after `a`). For example:  
  - If `a` occurs at time **t=5**, `b` must be true at **t=0, t=1, ..., t=5, t=6, ...**  
- **Violation Scenario**: The formula fails if `a` occurs at some time **t**, but `b` is **false at any time before/after `t`** (even once).
