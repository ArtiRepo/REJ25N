### Translation and Explanation of LTL Formula: `a U b`

**Original LTL Formula:**  
`a U b`

---

#### Step 1: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
The formula `a U b` consists of the binary temporal operator **`U` (Until)** and the atomic propositions `a` and `b`. The parsing tree is:  

```
      U (Until)
     /   \
    a     b
```

- **Leaves**:  
  - `a`: An atomic proposition (e.g., "the door is open").  
  - `b`: An atomic proposition (e.g., "the alarm sounds").  
- **Operator**:  
  - `U` (Until): Requires `a` to hold continuously *until* `b` becomes true, with `b` eventually becoming true at some future state.  

---

#### Step 2: Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up  
1. **Atomic Propositions (`a`, `b`)**  
   - Each represents a state-based condition:  
     - `a` must evaluate to true or false at each point in time.  
     - `b` must evaluate to true or false at each point in time.  

2. **`U` (Until) Core Semantics**  
   - `a U b` is satisfied at the current state `i` if:  
     - **Eventually**, there exists a future state `j` (where `j ≥ i`) where `b` is **true**.  
     - **Continuously**, for every state between `i` and `j-1` (inclusive of `i`, exclusive of `j`), `a` must be **true**.  
   - **Special case**: If `b` is **already true at state `i`**, the formula is immediately satisfied (no requirement for `a` at any state).  

---

#### Step 3: Natural Language Translation  
- **Key phrase**:  
  > *"`a` must hold continuously **until** `b` becomes true, and `b` **must eventually** become true."*  

- **Refined for clarity**:  
  - **Requirement 1 (Eventually)**: `b` **will happen** at some future time (could be immediately, or after some steps).  
  - **Requirement 2 (Continuously)**: From the **current moment** until the **moment immediately before `b` becomes true**, `a` must **hold without interruption**.  
  - **Outcome**: Once `b` becomes true, the constraint on `a` ceases. If `b` is already true, no further checks are needed.  
  - **Non-negotiable**: Failure occurs if `b` never happens, or if `a` fails before `b` occurs.  

---

#### Step 4: Example Scenarios  
- **Valid ("Formula holds")**:  
  - `[a=true, b=true]`: ✅ `b` is true now (no need for `a`).  
  - `[a=true, b=false] → [a=true, b=true]`: ✅ `a` holds until `b` becomes true.  
  - `[a=true, b=false] → [a=true, b=false] → [a=true, b=true]`: ✅ `a` holds continuously until `b` becomes true.  

- **Invalid ("Formula fails")**:  
  - `[a=true, b=false] → [a=false, b=false]`: ❌ `a` breaks before `b` occurs.  
  - `a remains true forever, but b never true`: ❌ `b` fails to eventually occur.  

---

#### Final Natural Language Phrasing  
> *"`b` must eventually become true, and until the exact moment `b` happens, `a` must remain continuously true."*  

This phrasing:  
- Uses precise temporal language ("continuously," "eventually").  
- Clarifies that `a` is **not required** when `b` becomes true.  
- Emphasizes the non-negotiable future occurrence of `b`.
