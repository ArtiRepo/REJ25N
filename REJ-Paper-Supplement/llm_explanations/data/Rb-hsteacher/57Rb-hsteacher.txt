### Translation of LTL Formula: **Fa and G(a → XG¬a)**

#### Step 1: Original LTL Formula  
`Fa ∧ G(a → XG¬a)`  

#### Step 2: Parse Tree Breakdown  
The formula is a conjunction of two subformulas. Here’s the parsing tree:  
```
         ∧
        / \
       /   \
     Fa    G(→)
          /   \
         /     \
        a      X(G(¬))
                 |
                 a
```  
- **Top-level operator**: `∧` (conjunction of `Fa` and `G(a → XG¬a)`).  
- **Left branch**:  
  - `F a`: "Eventually, `a` holds."  
- **Right branch**:  
  - `G(...)`: "Globally, `a → XG¬a` must hold."  
    * **Nested implication**: `a → XG¬a`  
      - `a`: Atomic proposition.  
      - `XG¬a`: `X` (Next) applied to `G¬a`.  
        - `G¬a`: "Globally, `a` is **false** from some point onward."  

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning Bottom-Up  
1. **Innermost subformula (`G¬a`)**  
   - *Meaning*: "`a` is **always false** from some future time onward."  
   - *Key constraint*: Once `¬a` becomes true, **it remains true forever**.  

2. **Apply `X` to `G¬a` (`XG¬a`)**  
   - *Meaning*: "At the **next time step**, `G¬a` becomes true."  
   - *Inference*: Starting from the *next* state, `a` will be **permanently false**.  

3. **Implication: `a → XG¬a`**  
   - *Meaning*: "If `a` is true **now**, then **starting next time**, `a` must be **forever false**."  
   - *Key insight*: This enforces that any occurrence of `a` is **immediately followed** by permanent falsity.  

4. **Apply `G` to the implication: `G(a → XG¬a)`**  
   - *Meaning*: **At every future time**, if `a` holds, it triggers permanent falsity starting from the *next* state.  
   - *Constraint*: If `a` is true **at any point**, it **cannot hold again** after the immediate next state.  

5. **Conjunction with `Fa` (`Fa ∧ ...`)**  
   - `Fa`: Ensures `a` **holds at least once** (immediately or later).  
   - Combined with `G(a → XG¬a)`: Limits `a` to a **single occurrence** (if `a` occurs, it forces permanent `¬a` afterward).  

#### Step 4: Unified Meaning & Constraints  
- **Overall effect**:  
  - **There is exactly *one time* where `a` is true** (since `Fa` requires occurrence, and `G(a → XG¬a)` restricts recurrence).  
  - **After this occurrence, `a` is *permanently false* from the next state onward**.  

- **Violations**:  
  - If `a` never holds → violates `Fa`.  
  - If `a` holds twice (e.g., at times `t` and `t+k`, `k≥1`) → violates the implication at time `t` (since `a` reappearing breaks `XG¬a`).  
  - If `a` holds but `¬a` fails later → violates `XG¬a`.  

#### Refined Natural Language Phrasing  
> **"Proposition `a` must become true *exactly once*. Immediately after this occurs, `a` becomes and remains **false forever**."**

|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Fa`                 | "Eventually, `a` is true at least once."                                                       |
| `G(a → XG¬a)`       | "Whenever `a` is true, from the very next moment onward, `a` is *always* false."               |
| `Fa ∧ G(a → XG¬a)` | **Unified**: "`a` holds *exactly once* in the timeline, and after that, it is permanently false." |
