### Translation of LTL Formula: **F (!y & w)**

#### Step 1: Original Formula  
The LTL formula to translate is:  
**F (!y & w)**  

---

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
The formula can be broken down into a parsing tree as follows:  
```
     F         (Eventually operator)
      |
      &        (Conjunction: AND)
     / \
    !   w     (Left: Negation; Right: Atomic proposition)
    |
    y          (Atomic proposition)
```  
- **Atomic Propositions**:  
  - `y` and `w` are Boolean variables representing system states (e.g., "the system is faulty" for `y`, "the system is operational" for `w`).  
- **Negation (`!`)**:  
  - `!y` means "not `y`" (logical negation).  
- **Conjunction (`&`)**:
  - `!y & w` requires **both `!y` and `w` to be true at the same time** (e.g., "not faulty AND operational").  
- **Temporal Operator (`F`)**:
  - `F` ("Eventually") means the subformula **must hold at some state in the future**.

---

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning (Bottom-Up)  
1. **Base Components**:  
   - `y`: "The system is faulty."  
   - `!y`: "The system is **not** faulty."  
   - `w`: "The system is operational."  
   
2. **Conjunction (`!y & w`)**:  
   - Combines `!y` and `w` into:  
     *"The system is **operational and not faulty**."*  
   - **Timing Constraint**: Both conditions must be true **simultaneously** at a state.  

3. **Temporal Operator (`F`)**:  
   - Applies to `(!y & w)`, requiring this state to occur **at least once** in the future:  
     *"Eventually (at some future time), the system is operational and not faulty."*  

---

#### Step 4: Refined Natural Language Phrasing  
- **Basic Translation**:  
  > *"Eventually, the system is operational and not faulty."*  

- **Clarity Enhancements**:  
  - **Emphasize Concurrency**:  
    > *"The system must reach a future state where it is **simultaneously operational and free of faults**."*  
    (Clarifies that `w` and `!y` must hold at the **same time**.)  

  - **Requirement-Oriented Phrasing**:  
    > *"There must come a time when the system operates correctly while being fault-free."*  
    (Uses domain-friendly terminology to stress system constraints.)  

  - **Unambiguous Timing**:  
    > *"At some point in the future—whether now or later—the system is both operational and not faulty."*  
    (Accounts for the possibility of immediate satisfaction.)  

---

#### When Is the Formula Satisfied?  
- **True**: If there exists **any future state** (including the current one) where `w` is true and `y` is false.  
  *Example:* A system that recovers from a fault and becomes operational.  
- **False**: If the system **never** enters a state where `w` holds and `y` is false.  
  *Example:* A system stuck with faults (`y` true) or never operational (`w` false).  

#### Constraints on the System  
- **No Timing Guarantees**: The formula allows the event to happen **anytime** (e.g., immediately, after seconds, or years).  
- **No Other Obligations**: States **before or after** the satisfying state can be arbitrary (e.g., the system may be faulty again afterward).  
- **Liveness Requirement**: Ensures progress toward a "good" state but **no safety guarantees** (e.g., avoids perpetual bad states).  

### Final Natural Language Translation  
> **"Eventually, the system must enter a state where it is operational and not faulty."**  

This balances precision, clarity, and the temporal/system constraints inherent in LTL, suitable for requirements engineering.
