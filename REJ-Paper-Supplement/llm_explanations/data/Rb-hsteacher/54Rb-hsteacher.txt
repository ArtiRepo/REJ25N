To translate the LTL formula \((a \mathbin{\mathbf{U}} b) \land \mathbf{G}(a)\) into natural language, I'll follow the structured reasoning process:

### 1. **Original LTL Formula**
\[
(a \mathbin{\mathbf{U}} b) \land \mathbf{G}(a)
\]

### 2. **Parse Tree Breakdown**
The formula is a conjunction (\(\land\)) of two subformulas:
- **Left subformula**: Unary Operator \(\mathbf{U}\) (Until) applied to \(a\) and \(b\) → \(a \mathbin{\mathbf{U}} b\)
- **Right subformula**: Unary Operator \(\mathbf{G}\) (Globally) applied to \(a\) → \(\mathbf{G}(a)\)

**Parsing Tree**:
```
        ∧ (and)
      /     \
   U (Until) G (Globally)
  /   \        \
a      b        a
```

### 3. **Rebuild Meaning from Bottom Up**
##### Atomic Propositions
- **\(a\)**: Atomic proposition (e.g., "Property \(a\) holds").
- **\(b\)**: Atomic proposition (e.g., "Property \(b\) holds").

##### Subformula: \(a \mathbin{\mathbf{U}} b\)
- **LTL Semantics**: "\(a\) holds continuously **until** a time when \(b\) holds, and \(b\) **must eventually hold**."  
  - Requires:  
    1. \(b\) becomes true at some future time \(k\) (starting from now).  
    2. \(a\) holds **at every time step** until \(k\) (including now, but not requiring \(a\) to hold at \(k\) itself¹).

##### Subformula: \(\mathbf{G}(a)\)
- **LTL Semantics**: "\(a\) **always holds globally**."  
  - Requires \(a\) to hold **at every future time step indefinitely**, including the present and all moments beyond.

##### Combined Formula: \((a \mathbin{\mathbf{U}} b) \land \mathbf{G}(a)\)
- The conjunction requires **both** subformulas to hold:  
  1. \(b\) must eventually occur, with \(a\) holding continuously until then.  
  2. \(a\) holds at all times, **including after \(b\) occurs**.  

**Key insight**:  
- \(\mathbf{G}(a)\) forces \(a\) to hold **forever**, starting now. This implies:  
  - In \(a \mathbin{\mathbf{U}} b\), the requirement for "\(a\) to hold until \(b\)" is automatically satisfied (because \(a\) is always true).  
  - The critical constraint reduces to: **"Eventually \(b\) must hold."**  

Thus, \((a \mathbin{\mathbf{U}} b) \land \mathbf{G}(a)\) is **equivalent to \(\mathbf{G}(a) \land \mathbf{F}(b)\)**:  
- \(a\) **holds at every future time** (global constraint).  
- \(b\) **holds at least once in the future** (eventuality constraint).  

### 4. **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**
> **"Property \(a\) must hold permanently (at every time, now and forever), and property \(b\) must eventually hold at least once."**

**Explanation of Constraints**:
- **When satisfied**:  
  - \(a\) never fails at any moment.  
  - \(b\) occurs at least once in the future (timing does not matter).  
  - **Example**:  
    - At \(t_0\): \(a=\text{true}\), \(b=\text{false}\).  
    - At \(t_1\): \(a=\text{true}\), \(b=\text{true}\) (then \(a\) remains true forever).  

- **When violated**:  
  - \(a\) fails at any time (e.g., \(a=\text{false}\) at \(t_2\)), **or**  
  - \(b\) **never** occurs (e.g., \(b=\text{false}\) for all time).  
  - **Example**:  
    - \(a\) always true, but \(b\) never occurs → violates \(a \mathbin{\mathbf{U}} b\).  
    - \(b\) occurs once, but \(a\) fails later (e.g., \(a=\text{false}\) at \(t_3\)) → violates \(\mathbf{G}(a)\).  

ⓘ **Note**:  
The until operator \(a \mathbin{\mathbf{U}} b\) does not require \(a\) to hold at the exact moment \(b\) becomes true, but \(\mathbf{G}(a)\) ensures it anyway. Thus, the core obligations are **global \(a\)** and **eventual \(b\)**.

### Summary
- **Formula**: \((a \mathbin{\mathbf{U}} b) \land \mathbf{G}(a)\)  
- **Natural Translation**:  
  *"a must always hold, and b must eventually hold."*  
- **Constraints**: Eternal truth of \(a\) + eventual occurrence of \(b\).
