### Translation of LTL Formula: `b U !d`

#### Original LTL Formula:
- `b U !d`

#### Parsing Tree Breakdown:
1. **Root operator**: `U` (Until)  
   - **Left operand**: Atomic proposition `b`  
   - **Right operand**: Negation `!` applied to the atomic proposition `d` (i.e., `!d` means "d is false").  

**Visual Tree**:  
```
      U  
     / \  
    b   !  
        |  
        d  
```

#### Step-by-Step Meaning Reconstruction (Bottom-Up):
1. **Atomic propositions**:  
   - `b`: A boolean property representing "b is true" at a specific moment.  
   - `d`: A boolean property representing "d is true" at a specific moment.  
   - `!d`: Negation of `d`, meaning "d is false" at a specific moment.  

2. **Apply the `U` (Until) operator**:  
   The formula `b U !d` means:  
   - There must exist a **future state** where `!d` holds (i.e., "d is false" for the first time after now).  
   - For **all states** from the current state (inclusive) **up to (but not including)** that future state:  
     `b` must hold (i.e., "b is true" in every state in this interval).  

#### Refined Natural Language Phrasing:
- **Final Translation**:  
  > "The system must eventually reach a state where `d` is false. At every state from now until **the moment immediately before** this occurs, `b` must be true."  

#### Key Explanations:
1. **When is the formula satisfied?**  
   - **Case 1 (Immediate satisfaction)**: If `d` is **currently false**, no requirement is imposed on `b` (since the "until" interval is empty).  
   - **Case 2 (Future satisfaction)**: If `d` is currently true, `b` must hold **continuously** until the **first future state** where `d` becomes false.  

2. **Constraints over time**:  
   - **Future event required**: `d` **must** eventually become false. The formula is violated if `d` stays true forever.  
   - **No constraint at `!d`-state**: When `d` becomes false, `b` can be **true or false**; the only requirement is that `b` held *until* (but not at) that exact moment.  
   - **Continuity of `b`**: Between the current time and the future `!d` event, `b` **cannot be false** at any intermediate state.  

#### Example:
- **Valid Path**: `b=true, b=true, d=false`  
  - At state 2: `d` becomes false → `!d` holds.  
  - States 0 and 1 have `b=true`.  
  - *Formula satisfied!*  
- **Invalid Paths**:  
  - `d=true` forever → Never reaches `!d` → **Violation**.  
  - `b=false, d=true, [...]` → `b` fails before `!d` occurs → **Violation**.  

**Summary**: `b U !d` ensures `b` holds *without interruption* until `d` becomes false for the first time, and `d` *must* eventually be falsified. This is crucial for specifying safety and liveness properties in systems (e.g., "keep the alarm on until a shutdown signal is received").
