To translate the LTL formula **G (n => s)** into natural language, follow this structured reasoning:

### 1. **Original LTL Formula**  
`G (n => s)`  

### 2. **Parsing Tree Breakdown**  
- **Operators**:  
  - `G` (*Globally*): Unary temporal operator.  
  - `=>` (*Implies*): Binary logical operator.  
- **Atomic Propositions**:  
  - `n`: A state condition (e.g., "alarm is triggered").  
  - `s`: Another state condition (e.g., "system logs activity").  

**Tree Structure**:  
```  
     G  
      \  
       =>  
      /   \  
     n     s  
```  

### 3. **Rebuild Meaning Bottom-Up**  
- **Step 1: Implication (`n => s`)**  
  - Meaning: "*If `n` is true, then `s` must be true.*"  
  - Formal logic: At a given time, if `n` holds, `s` must hold simultaneously.  
  - Violation: `n` is true but `s` is false at the same moment.  

- **Step 2: Globally (`G (n => s)`)**  
  - Applies the implication constraint to **every point in time** during system execution.  
  - Meaning: "*At all times, the rule 'if `n` then `s`' must hold.*"  
  - Violation: Any occurrence of `n`-without-`s` at a single time point invalidates the entire formula.  

### 4. **Refined Natural Language Translation**  
> **"It is always the case that whenever `n` holds, `s` must also hold at the same time."**  

#### **Key Explanations**:  
- **When is the formula satisfied?**  
  - All scenarios pass **except** moments where `n` is true and `s` is false.  
  - Examples of valid states:  
    - `n` false, `s` false/true → Implication holds.  
    - `n` true and `s` true → Valid.  
  - One counterexample (`n` true + `s` false) fails the entire run.  

- **Constraint Over Time**:  
  - The requirement is **continuously enforced**—every state in the system timeline must adhere to `n → s`.  
  - "`n`" being false imposes **no obligation** on "`s`" (e.g., if `n` is false, `s` can be true *or* false without penalty).  

### **Practical Example**  
- Suppose:  
  - `n`: "High temperature detected."  
  - `s`: "Cooling system activates."  
- Translation:  
  > *"Whenever the system detects high temperature, the cooling system must activate immediately—and this rule must hold for all times."*  
- **Violation**: A single instance of high temperature without cooling activation.  

### **Why This Matters in Requirements Engineering**  
- Encodes **safety properties** (e.g., "hazard `n` *always* requires response `s`").  
- Time-agnostic: Ensures no gaps in enforcement across the system’s entire execution.
