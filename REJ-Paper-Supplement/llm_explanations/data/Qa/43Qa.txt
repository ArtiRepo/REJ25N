- **Original LTL formula**:  
  $ X(f \land i) $

- **Breakdown (parsing tree)**:  
  - Root: $ X $ (Next operator)  
    - Child: $ (f \land i) $ (Conjunction of propositions "f" and "i")  

- **Rebuild meaning from the bottom up**:  
  - The conjunction $ f \land i $ means "both f and i are true in the current state."  
  - The $ X $ operator shifts this requirement to the *next state*: "The next state must satisfy $ f \land i $."  
  - Together, $ X(f \land i) $ means: **In the next state after the current one, both f and i are true**.  

- **Refined natural language phrasing**:  
  **"The system must ensure that both f and i are simultaneously true in the immediate next time step."**  

  **When is the formula satisfied?**  
  The formula is satisfied in a path if, for the first next state (i.e., the state at time $ t+1 $), both $ f $ and $ i $ are true. This applies regardless of the current state (the formula does not impose constraints on the current state itself).  

  **Constraints on the system over time**:  
  The formula imposes a requirement on the system's *immediate transition*: Every state in the system's execution must be followed by a state where $ f $ and $ i $ are both true. It does not restrict the current state but enforces a condition on the next state in the sequence.
