- **Original LTL formula**:  
  $ F (f \Rightarrow j) $

- **Parsing tree breakdown**:  
  - **Main operator**: $ F $ (Eventually)  
    - **Subformula**: $ (f \Rightarrow j) $ (If $ f $, then $ j $)  
      - **Left operand of implication**: $ f $ (A proposition)  
      - **Right operand of implication**: $ j $ (Another proposition)  

- **Rebuilding meaning from the bottom of the tree**:  
  1. $ f \Rightarrow j $: This is a logical implication, meaning "if $ f $ is true, then $ j $ must also be true" at a given point in time.  
  2. $ F (f \Rightarrow j) $: The $ F $ operator ("Eventually") indicates that the implication $ f \Rightarrow j $ must hold **at some point in the future** along the system's execution path.  
  3. Combining these, the formula requires that **there exists at least one moment in the future** where the condition "if $ f $, then $ j $" is satisfied. This does not mandate that $ f \Rightarrow j $ holds continuously or from the beginning; it only needs to be true at **some specific future time**.

- **Refined natural language phrasing**:  
  "There will eventually come a time where, if $ f $ is true, then $ j $ is also true."  
  Alternatively: "At some point in the future, the system must ensure that $ f $ implies $ j $."  

  **Explanation of satisfaction and constraints**:  
  - The formula is **satisfied** if, along the system's execution path, there exists at least one moment where $ f $ is false or $ j $ is true (since $ f \Rightarrow j $ is logically equivalent to $ \neg f \lor j $).  
  - It **imposes a constraint** that the system must reach a state where the relationship $ f \Rightarrow j $ is guaranteed, but it allows for earlier or later violations of this implication. For example, the system could have $ f $ true and $ j $ false in some prior states, as long as there is a **single future state** where $ f \Rightarrow j $ is satisfied.  

  **Example**: If $ f $ represents "fire alarm rings" and $ j $ represents "people evacuate," the formula would mean: "At some point in the future, if the fire alarm rings, then people must have evacuated by that time." This does not require that evacuations always follow alarms, only that there is **a specific future moment** where this condition is met.
