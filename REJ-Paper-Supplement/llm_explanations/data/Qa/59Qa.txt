- **Original LTL formula**: G((a ∧ Xa) → XX¬a)  
- **Breakdown (parsing tree)**:  
  - **G** (Global) applies to the entire implication.  
  - The implication (→) has:  
    - **Antecedent**: (a ∧ Xa) (a is true **now** and **next**).  
    - **Consequent**: XX¬a (a is **false two time steps ahead**).  

- **Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up**:  
  1. **XX¬a**: "Two time steps from now, a is false."  
  2. **Xa**: "a is true in the next time step."  
  3. **(a ∧ Xa)**: "a is true **now** and **next**."  
  4. **(a ∧ Xa) → XX¬a**: "If a is true now and next, then a must be false two steps ahead."  
  5. **G((a ∧ Xa) → XX¬a)**: "At **all times**, if a is true now and next, then a must be false two steps ahead."  

- **Refined natural language phrasing**:  
  "**At every moment in time, if a is currently true and will also be true in the next moment, then a must not be true two moments later.**"  

  **Explanation**:  
  - The formula imposes a constraint that **two consecutive a's** (at time t and t+1) **must be followed by a non-a at time t+2**.  
  - It ensures that no sequence of three consecutive a's can occur. If the system ever has a and Xa (i.e., a is true at t and t+1), the next state (t+2) must explicitly have ¬a.  
  - If the antecedent (a ∧ Xa) is false (e.g., a is false at t or t+1), the implication is vacuously true, and no constraint is applied.
