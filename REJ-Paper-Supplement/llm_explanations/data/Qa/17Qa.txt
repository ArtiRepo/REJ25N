- **Original LTL Formula**: !G c  
- **Parsing Tree Breakdown**:  
  - Root: **Negation (!)**  
    - Child: **Globally (G)**  
      - Child: **Proposition (c)**  

- **Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up**:  
  1. **G c** means "c is true at all future times" (i.e., c holds globally across the entire timeline).  
  2. **!G c** negates this, meaning "it is not the case that c is true at all future times."  
  3. This implies that **there exists at least one moment in time where c is false**.  

- **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**:  
  "The system must not have c hold indefinitely. There must be at least one point in time where c is false."  

  **Explanation**:  
  - **Satisfied**: When c is false at **some** moment in the system's execution.  
  - **Constraints Over Time**: The formula prohibits c from being **always true**. It allows c to be true at some times but requires it to be false at **least one** time. Essentially, it enforces that c is not a perpetual condition.
