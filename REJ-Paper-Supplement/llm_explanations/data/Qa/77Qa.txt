- **Original LTL formula**:  
  $ a \, \mathcal{U} \, \neg a $  

- **Breakdown (parsing tree)**:  
  The formula is a **"Until" (U)** operator with two subformulas:  
  - Left subformula: $ a $ (the atomic proposition "a is true").  
  - Right subformula: $ \neg a $ (the negation of "a is true").  
  The structure is:  
  ```
      U
     / \
    a  ¬a
  ```  

- **Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up**:  
  1. **Atomic proposition $ a $**: "a is true."  
  2. **Atomic proposition $ \neg a $**: "a is false."  
  3. **"Until" operator $ a \, \mathcal{U} \, \neg a $**:  
     - This requires that **"a is true at every time step until some future time** where **"a is false" becomes true.  
     - In other words, **there exists a moment in the future where $ \neg a $ is true**, and **before that moment, $ a $ must always be true**.  
  4. **Constraints over time**:  
     - The system must satisfy $ a $ **initially**, but **eventually switch to $ \neg a $**.  
     - If $ a $ remains true forever (i.e., $ \neg a $ never occurs), the formula is **not satisfied**.  
     - If $ a $ is false at the start, the formula is **not satisfied** (since $ a $ must hold before $ \neg a $).  

- **Refined natural language phrasing**:  
  **"a must hold continuously until it becomes false, and it is guaranteed to become false eventually."**  

**Explanation**:  
- The formula is **satisfied** if the system starts with $ a $ being true and transitions to $ \neg a $ at some future point.  
- It **imposes constraints** by ensuring:  
  - $ a $ is true for all time steps up to a specific point (inclusive).  
  - $ a $ is not allowed to remain true forever.  
  - If $ a $ ever becomes false before the initial time, the constraint is violated.
