- **Original LTL formula**:  
  $$(b \, U \, c) \land (d \, U \, \neg b)$$

- **Parsing tree breakdown**:  
  - **Top-level operator**: Conjunction ($\land$) of two subformulas:  
    1. **Subformula 1**: $b \, U \, c$ (b until c)  
    2. **Subformula 2**: $d \, U \, \neg b$ (d until not b)  

- **Rebuilding meaning from the bottom of the tree up**:  
  1. **$b \, U \, c$** means: **"b must hold at all times until c becomes true, and c must eventually occur."**  
     - This requires that at some future time, $c$ is true, and for every moment before that time, $b$ is true.  
  2. **$d \, U \, \neg b$** means: **"d must hold at all times until b becomes false, and b must eventually become false."**  
     - This requires that at some future time, $\neg b$ is true, and for every moment before that time, $d$ is true.  
  3. **Conjunction ($\land$)**: **Both conditions must be true simultaneously.**  
     - Thus, $c$ must eventually be true while $b$ is always true before $c$; and $b$ must eventually become false while $d$ is always true before that.  

- **Refined natural language phrasing**:  
  **"The system must satisfy two constraints: (1) c eventually occurs, and b remains true until c is true; and (2) d remains true until b becomes false. Crucially, b cannot become false before c has occurred—c must happen first, and b must stay true until then, while d remains true until b turns false (which can happen at the same time as c, but not earlier)."**  

**Explanation**:  
- The formula enforces that **c is guaranteed to happen at some point**, and **b is true during all prior moments**.  
- It also enforces that **b eventually becomes false**, with **d being true during all prior moments**.  
- **Key dependency**: The time when $c$ becomes true must occur **no later than** the time when $\neg b$ becomes true (i.e., $c$ must happen before or at the same time as $\neg b$). If $\neg b$ occurs before $c$, the first subformula $b \, U \, c$ would fail, as $b$ would be false before $c$ is true.  
- **Result**: The system must have a temporal sequence where $c$ is true first, $b$ is true until $c$ triggers, and then $d$ is true until $b$ is negated (which can coincide with $c$).
