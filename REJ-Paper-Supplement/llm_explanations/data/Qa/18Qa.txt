- **Original LTL formula**: `!F (a & b)`  
  (This formula states that it is not true that "eventually a and b are both true".)

- **Parsing tree breakdown**:  
  The formula has the following structure:  
  - Root: Negation (`!`)  
    - Child: Future operator (`F`)  
      - Child: Conjunction (`&`)  
        - Left: Proposition `a`  
        - Right: Proposition `b`  

  The hierarchy is:  
  `! [F [a & b]]` → "Not (Eventually (a and b))"

- **Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up**:  
  1. **`a & b`**: Both `a` and `b` are true *at the same time*.  
  2. **`F (a & b)`**: There exists *some future time* where `a & b` is true.  
  3. **`!F (a & b)`**: It is *not the case* that there exists a future time where `a & b` is true. In other words, **for all future times**, `a & b` is false.  
  4. This can be rephrased as: **"It is never true that both a and b hold simultaneously."**

- **Refined natural language phrasing**:  
  **"a and b must never occur together at any point in the future."**  
  or  
  **"The system must ensure that a and b are not both true at the same time."**  

  **Explanation**:  
  - **When satisfied**: The formula holds if, during the entire execution of the system, there is no moment where both `a` and `b` are true.  
  - **Constraints over time**: It imposes a *non-concurrency* requirement on `a` and `b`—they must not be true in the same state, and this must remain true indefinitely.
