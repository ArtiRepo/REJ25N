- **Original LTL formula**: XXXa  
- **Breakdown (parsing tree)**:  
  - The formula is a sequence of three **Next (X)** operators applied to the atomic proposition **a**.  
  - Structure:  
    ```  
    XXXa  
    └── X  
        └── X  
            └── X  
                └── a  
    ```  
  - Each **X** represents "the next time step."  

- **Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up**:  
  1. **a**: The atomic proposition "a" is true at the current time step.  
  2. **Xa**: "a is true at the next time step" (i.e., one step ahead).  
  3. **XXa**: "a is true at the time step after the next" (i.e., two steps ahead).  
  4. **XXXa**: "a is true at the time step three steps ahead" (i.e., **three steps from the current moment**).  

- **Refined natural language phrasing**:  
  **"The proposition 'a' must be true three time units into the future."**  

  **Explanation**:  
  - This formula imposes a constraint that the system's state three steps ahead must satisfy **a**.  
  - It is satisfied if, for the current time step **t**, the state at **t+3** has **a**.  
  - The constraint applies to a **specific future point** (exactly three steps ahead), not to all future time steps. For example, if the system runs for at least four time units, the third time step after the initial state must guarantee **a**.  

  **Key Insight**:  
  - Unlike **G** (globally) or **F** (finally), **XXXa** only requires **a** to hold at the precise third next time step, not repeatedly or eventually. It does not impose ongoing constraints beyond that single point in time.
