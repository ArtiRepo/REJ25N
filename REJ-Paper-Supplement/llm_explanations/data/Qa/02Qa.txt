- **Original LTL formula**:  
  $ X\, b \Rightarrow \neg X\, d $  

- **Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)**:  
  The formula is an implication ($ \Rightarrow $) between two subformulas:  
  1. **Left-hand side (LHS)**: $ X\, b $ (Next $ b $)  
  2. **Right-hand side (RHS)**: $ \neg X\, d $ (Not Next $ d $)  

  Parsing tree:  
  ```
  Implication
  ├── Next (b)
  └── Not Next (d)
  ```

- **Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up**:  
  - $ X\, b $: The proposition $ b $ must hold in the **next state**.  
  - $ \neg X\, d $: The proposition $ d $ must **not hold** in the **next state**.  
  - $ X\, b \Rightarrow \neg X\, d $: For every state in the system’s execution, **if** the next state satisfies $ b $, **then** the next state must **not** satisfy $ d $.  

  This enforces a constraint that $ b $ and $ d $ cannot both be true in the same next state. If $ b $ is true in the next state, $ d $ must be false there, but if $ b $ is false in the next state, the formula imposes no restriction on $ d $.

- **Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity**:  
  "In all subsequent states, $ b $ and $ d $ cannot both be true. Specifically, if $ b $ is true in the next state, then $ d $ must be false in that same next state."  

  Or more concisely:  
  "**If $ b $ is true in the next step, then $ d $ must be false in the next step.**"  

  This captures the temporal dependency: the truth of $ b $ in the immediate future (next state) **requires** the falsity of $ d $ in that same immediate future. The formula does not restrict $ b $ or $ d $ in the current state, only their relationship in the next state.
