- **Original LTL Formula**:  
  $ G(a \rightarrow X\neg b) $

- **Parsing Tree Breakdown**:  
  - Root: $ G $ (Globally)  
    - Child: $ a \rightarrow X\neg b $ (Implication)  
      - Left Subtree: $ a $ (Proposition)  
      - Right Subtree: $ X\neg b $ (Next + Negation)  
        - Child: $ \neg b $ (Negation)  
          - Child: $ b $ (Proposition)

- **Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up**:  
  1. $ \neg b $: "b is false."  
  2. $ X\neg b $: "In the next state, b is false."  
  3. $ a \rightarrow X\neg b $: "If a is true at a given time, then in the next state, b must be false."  
  4. $ G(a \rightarrow X\neg b) $: "This implication must hold at *all* times. Whenever a occurs, the system must ensure that b is false in the *immediately following* state."

- **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**:  
  "At all times, if **a** is true, then **b** must be false in the next state. This means **a** and **b** cannot occur consecutively: every occurrence of **a** must be immediately followed by a state where **b** is not true."  

  **Explanation**:  
  - The formula enforces a strict temporal constraint: **a** cannot be followed by **b** in the next time step.  
  - If **a** is true at any moment, the system must *guarantee* **b** is false in the subsequent moment.  
  - If **a** is false, no constraint is placed on **b** (it may be true or false).  
  - Example violation: A sequence like $ a = \text{true}, b = \text{true} $ in consecutive states would break the rule.
