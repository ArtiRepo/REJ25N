- **Original LTL formula**:  
  `(a U b) & (c U d)`  

- **Parsing tree breakdown**:  
  - The formula is a conjunction (`&`) of two subformulas:  
    1. `(a U b)` (a "until" b)  
    2. `(c U d)` (c "until" d)  
  - Each "until" operator (`U`) requires that the first condition (`a` or `c`) holds continuously until the second condition (`b` or `d`) becomes true, and the second condition must eventually occur.  

- **Rebuilding meaning from the bottom up**:  
  - For `(a U b)`: The system must satisfy `a` at every point in time until `b` becomes true. Additionally, `b` must eventually become true.  
  - For `(c U d)`: Similarly, the system must satisfy `c` at every point in time until `d` becomes true, and `d` must eventually occur.  
  - The conjunction (`&`) combines these two constraints, meaning **both** temporal conditions must be true simultaneously in the system's execution.  

- **Refined natural language phrasing**:  
  **"The system must ensure that 'a holds continuously until b occurs' and 'c holds continuously until d occurs.' Both b and d must eventually be true, and during the time before b and d occur, a and c must remain true, respectively."**  

- **Explanation of satisfaction and constraints**:  
  - The formula is **satisfied** if, in the system's timeline:  
    1. `a` is true at all points until `b` becomes true (and `b` eventually happens).  
    2. `c` is true at all points until `d` becomes true (and `d` eventually happens).  
  - It **imposes constraints over time** by requiring:  
    - For `a U b`: `a` must persist until `b` is triggered, no matter how long it takes.  
    - For `c U d`: `c` must persist until `d` is triggered, no matter how long it takes.  
    - Both conditions must be met in the same execution path, meaning the system cannot allow either `a` to stop before `b` or `c` to stop before `d`.
