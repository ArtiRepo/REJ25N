- **Original LTL formula**: F !b  
  (This reads as "Eventually, not b" in LTL notation.)  

- **Break the subformula into a parsing tree (breakdown)**:  
  - The formula consists of the **Future (F)** operator, which applies to the subformula **!b**.  
  - The **!b** (negation of proposition b) is a simple atomic formula with a negation applied to it.  
  - Parsing tree:  
    ```
        F  
        │  
     ┌─────┐  
     !     b  
    ```  

- **Rebuild meaning from the bottom of the tree up**:  
  1. Start with **b**: This represents a proposition (e.g., "the system is in a safe state").  
  2. Apply **!** (negation): **!b** means "b is false" (e.g., "the system is not in a safe state").  
  3. Apply **F** (Future): **F !b** means "At some point in the future, **!b** is true" (e.g., "The system must eventually not be in a safe state").  

- **Refine the natural language phrasing for clarity**:  
  - **Translation**: "Eventually, b will be false."  
  - **Explanation**:  
    - The formula **F !b** is **satisfied** if, in the system's execution, there exists at least one moment in the future where **b** is false.  
    - It **imposes a constraint** that **b cannot remain true forever**. The system must transition to a state where **b** is false at some point in time.  
    - For example, if **b** represents "the light is on," then **F !b** translates to "The light must eventually turn off."  

This phrasing emphasizes that the condition is about the **occurrence of a future event** where **b** is false, rather than a permanent state or a recurring one.
