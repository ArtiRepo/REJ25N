- **Original LTL formula**:  
  `G (!f | !i)`  

- **Breakdown (parsing tree)**:  
  - The formula is a **Globally** (`G`) operator applied to a **Disjunction** (`|`) of two **Negations** (`!f` and `!i`).  
  - **Subformulas**:  
    - `G` (Globally)  
    - `!f` (Negation of `f`)  
    - `!i` (Negation of `i`)  
    - `!f | !i` (Disjunction of the negations).  

- **Rebuild meaning from the bottom up**:  
  1. `!f` means "f is false" (at a given time).  
  2. `!i` means "i is false" (at a given time).  
  3. `!f | !i` means "At any time, either f is false or i is false (or both)."  
  4. `G (!f | !i)` means "At **all times**, the condition `!f | !i` must hold."  

  This translates to: **"For every moment in time, at least one of f or i must be false."**  

- **Refined natural language phrasing**:  
  **"It is always the case that either f is false or i is false."**

  **Explanation**:  
  - The formula is satisfied when **f and i are never both true at the same time**.  
  - It imposes a **constraint over time**: in every state of the system's execution, at least one of the propositions `f` or `i` must be false.  
  - If both `f` and `i` ever become true simultaneously, the formula is violated.  

  **Alternative phrasing**:  
  **"Both f and i cannot be true at the same time in any state of the system's behavior."**
