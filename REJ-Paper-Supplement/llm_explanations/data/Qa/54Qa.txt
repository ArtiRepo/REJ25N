- **Original LTL formula**: (a U b) ∧ G(a)  
  **Explanation**:  
  This formula combines two conditions: (1) "a holds until b becomes true" (a U b) and (2) "a is always true" (G(a)).

### **Parsing Tree Breakdown**  
The formula can be decomposed into:  
```
        ∧  
      /   \  
    (U)    G(a)  
   / \     /  
  a   b   a  
```  
- The **top-level operator** is conjunction (AND), which requires both subformulas to hold.  
- The **first subformula** (a U b) represents the **"until"** operator, meaning "a continues to hold until b becomes true."  
- The **second subformula** G(a) represents the **"globally"** operator, meaning "a is always true."

### **Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom of the Tree**  
1. **G(a)**: "a is true at all times" (forever, without exception).  
2. **(a U b)**: "a is true until b becomes true." This requires that:  
   - At some point in the future, **b becomes true**.  
   - **Before that point**, **a is true** (and remains true until b is true).  
3. **Combined logic**: Since G(a) ensures **a is always true**, the "until" condition (a U b) simplifies to:  
   - **a is always true** (from G(a)), and **b eventually becomes true** (from (a U b)).

### **Refined Natural Language Phrasing**  
"The system must satisfy two constraints:  
1. **a is always true** throughout its entire execution.  
2. **b eventually occurs** at some point in the future.  

**When the formula is satisfied**:  
- At all time steps, **a is true**.  
- At some time step, **b becomes true** (and this must happen before or at the same time as the end of the system’s execution).  

**Constraints over time**:  
- a cannot ever be false (due to G(a)).  
- b must be true at least once in the future (due to the combination of a U b and G(a), as a is always true, ensuring the "until" condition only depends on b eventually being true)."  

**Translation**:  
"**a must always hold**, and **b will eventually occur**."  

--- 

### **Key Insight**  
The conjunction ensures that:  
- **a is forever true** (G(a)).  
- **b is true at some future time** (since (a U b) requires b to eventually be true when a is always true).
