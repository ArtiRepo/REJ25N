- **Original LTL formula**:  
  $ a \ \mathbf{U} \ (c \ \land \ d) $  

- **Parsing tree breakdown**:  
  - Root: **Until (U)**  
    - Left child: **a** (a proposition)  
    - Right child: **Conjunction (&)**  
      - Left child: **c** (a proposition)  
      - Right child: **d** (a proposition)  

- **Rebuilt meaning from the bottom up**:  
  1. **c ∧ d**: Both c and d must be true **simultaneously** at some future point.  
  2. **a U (c ∧ d)**: The proposition **a** must be **true in all states from the current one onward** until the moment when **c ∧ d** becomes true. The "until" operator ensures that **a** is not allowed to be false before **c ∧ d** is satisfied. Additionally, **c ∧ d must eventually occur** (otherwise, the formula is never satisfied).  

- **Refined natural language phrasing**:  
  "Condition **a** must remain true at every step in the system's execution until **both c and d are simultaneously true**. If **c and d** are never both true, the formula is never satisfied. However, once **c and d** become true, the requirement on **a** no longer applies."  

- **Key constraints and satisfaction conditions**:  
  - **Satisfied**: When **a** is true in all states up to and including the first time **c ∧ d** becomes true.  
  - **Imposes constraints**:  
    - **a** must not be false at any point before **c ∧ d** is satisfied.  
    - **c ∧ d** must eventually be true (the system cannot indefinitely avoid it).  
  - **Violated**: If **a** becomes false before **c ∧ d** is satisfied, or if **c ∧ d** is never satisfied.
