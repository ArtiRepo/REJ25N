### Translation of LTL Formula: **X (t & y)**  
**Original Formula:** `X (t & y)`

### Step-by-Step Breakdown via Parsing Tree
1. **Atomic Propositions** (leaf nodes):  
   - `t`: Represents a Boolean variable; true or false at any moment.  
   - `y`: Represents another Boolean variable; true or false at any moment.  

2. **Conjunction Operator** (`&`):  
   - Subformula: `t & y`  
   - **Meaning**: Requires **both `t` and `y`** to be true **simultaneously** at a **single moment** in time.  
   - **Constraints**: Only applies to the specific moment it is evaluated.

3. **"Next" Operator** (`X`):  
   - Formula: `X (t & y)`  
   - **Meaning**: Shifts the evaluation of `(t & y)` to the **immediately following moment**.  
   - **Constraints**: Only concerns the **next state** after the current one.

### Detailed Explanation  

#### 1. **When Constraints Apply**:  
   - **Only at the immediate next state**:  
     The formula imposes constraints **exclusively** on the **very next moment** after the current state.  
     - **Variables affected**: `t` and `y` at time `i+1` (where the current time is `i`).  
   - **No constraints elsewhere**:  
     - **Current state** (`i`): `t` and `y` can be **any value** (true/false).  
     - **States beyond `i+1`** (e.g., `i+2`, `i+3`, ...): No requirements for `t` or `y`.  

#### 2. **Evaluation Over Time**:  
   - **At the current state** (`i`):  
     - The truth of `X (t & y)` **depends solely** on the **next state** (`i+1`).  
     - **No immediate action**: The formula does not require anything to hold in the current state.  
   - **At the next state** (`i+1`):  
     - The formula `X (t & y)` (evaluated at `i`) **ceases to impose constraints**. It is only concerned with `i+1` *as seen from `i`*.  
     - **New evaluations**: A separate `X (t & y)` evaluated at `i+1` would constrain state `i+2`, but this is independent.  

#### 3. **Satisfaction vs. Violation**:  
   - **Formula holds at state `i`** if:  
     ```  
     State i+1: t = true, y = true.  
     ```  
     *Example sequence*:  
     - `State i`:   `t=false, y=false` → **Irrelevant**  
     - `State i+1`: `t=true,  y=true`  → **Satisfies** `X (t & y)` at `i`.  

   - **Formula violated at state `i`** if:  
     ```  
     State i+1: t = false OR y = false (or both).  
     ```  
     *Example sequences*:  
     - `State i+1`: `t=true,  y=false` → **Violates** (since `y` is false).  
     - `State i+1`: `t=false, y=true` → **Violates** (since `t` is false).  
     - `State i+1`: `t=false, y=false` → **Violates**.  

#### 4. **Key Nuances & Misunderstandings**:  
   - **No long-term guarantees**:  
     A state `i+2` where `t` and `y` are false has **no impact** on truth of `X (t & y)` at `i`. Constraints terminate after `i+1`.  
   - **"Satisfaction now ≠ Future constraints"**:  
     The formula only asserts properties about `i+1` *from the perspective of `i`*. Once evaluated, it imposes **no further obligations** on the system.  
   - **Atomic propositions are momentary**:  
     `t` and `y` need only hold **at `i+1`**. Their values before/after are irrelevant.

### Summary  
> `X (t & y)` is **satisfied** at the current moment **if and only if** `t` and `y` are **both true** in the **immediately following moment**. It imposes **no constraints** on the present or any other future/past moments beyond this next state. Once the next moment occurs, the formula's constraints are **fully resolved** and no longer apply.
