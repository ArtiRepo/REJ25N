### Translation and Explanation of LTL Formula: \((c \land b) \mathrel{\mathcal{U}} a\)

#### Step 1: Original Formula  
\((c \land b) \mathrel{\mathcal{U}} a\)

#### Step 2: Parsing Tree Breakdown  
- **Root operator**: Until (\(\mathrel{\mathcal{U}}\))  
  - **Left operand**: Conjunction \((c \land b)\)  
    - Atomic proposition \(c\)  
    - Atomic proposition \(b\)  
  - **Right operand**: Atomic proposition \(a\)  

#### Step 3: Rebuilding Meaning from the Bottom Up  
1. **Atomic propositions**:  
   - \(c\), \(b\), and \(a\) represent system states (e.g., "component \(c\) is active," "action \(b\) occurs," "event \(a\) happens"). Their truth is evaluated at individual time points.  

2. **Conjunction \((c \land b)\)**:  
   - **Meaning**: Both \(c\) and \(b\) must be true **simultaneously** at the same time point.  
   - **Constraint**: Only applies at time points where the formula is active.  

3. **Until operator \((c \land b) \mathrel{\mathcal{U}} a\)**:  
   - **Semantics**:  
     - \(a\) must become true at **some finite future time** \(j\) (including the present).  
     - For **all time points** from **now** (time \(i\)) to **just before \(j\)**: \((c \land b)\) must hold.  
   - **Constraint timeline**:  
     - The "until" constraint starts **immediately** at evaluation time \(i\).  
     - Constraints on \((c \land b)\) **cease** once \(a\) becomes true at \(j\).  
     - There are **no constraints** for time points **after \(j\)** or **before \(i\)**.  

#### Step 4: Natural Language Translation and Refinement  
> "**Eventually, \(a\) must occur. Until the moment right before \(a\) occurs (if not already true now), both \(c\) and \(b\) must continuously hold together.**"  

### Detailed Explanation  
#### When Constraints Apply  
1. **Immediate constraints** (at time \(i\)):  
   - If \(a\) is **false** now: Both \(c\) and \(b\) must be **true immediately**.  
   - If \(a\) is **true** now: **No constraints** on \(c\) and \(b\) (the formula is instantly satisfied).  

2. **Ongoing constraints**:  
   - For every future time point **before \(a\) becomes true**:  
     - \((c \land b)\) must hold.  
     - If either \(c\) or \(b\) fails **before \(a\) occurs**, the formula is violated.  
   - **Once \(a\) is true** at time \(j\):  
     - Constraints on \(c\) and \(b\) **cease permanently**.  
     - The formula **never constrains** events after \(a\) happens.  

#### Truth Evaluation Over Time  
- **Satisfied** if:  
  - At evaluation time \(i\): \(a\) is true (no need to check \(c\) or \(b\)), **or**  
  - \(a\) is false at \(i\), but:  
    - \((c \land b)\) is true at \(i\), and  
    - This pattern continues **until** a future time \(j > i\) where \(a\) becomes true.  
  > *Example sequence*:  
  > \[
  > \begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
  > \text{Time} & t_0\, (\text{now}) & t_1 & t_2 \\
  > \hline
  > a & \text{F} & \text{F} & \color{green}{\text{T}} \\
  > b & \color{green}{\text{T}} & \color{green}{\text{T}} & \text{-} \\
  > c & \color{green}{\text{T}} & \color{green}{\text{T}} & \text{-} \\
  > \end{array}
  > \]  
  > Here, \((c \land b)\) holds at \(t_0\) and \(t_1\), and \(a\) becomes true at \(t_2\).  

- **Violated** if:  
  - \(a\) **never** becomes true, **or**  
  - At **any time** before \(a\) becomes true: Either \(c\) **or** \(b\) is false.  
  > *Violating sequences*:  
  > 1. \(a\) never occurs:  
  >    \[
  >    \begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}
  >    \text{Time} & t_0 & t_1 & t_2 & \text{...} \\
  \hline
  >    a & \text{F} & \text{F} & \text{F} & \text{F} \\
  >    b & \text{T} & \text{T} & \text{F} & \text{T} \\
  >    c & \text{T} & \text{T} & \text{T} & \text{T} \\
  >    \end{array}
  >    \]  
  >    \((c \land b)\) holds until \(t_1\), but \(a\) never happens → **VIOLATION**.  
  >  
  > 2. \((c \land b)\) fails before \(a\):  
  >    \[
  >    \begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
  >    \text{Time} & t_0 & t_1 & t_2 \\
  \hline
  >    a & \text{F} & \text{F} & \color{green}{\text{T}} \\
  >    b & \color{green}{\text{T}} & \color{red}{\text{F}} & \text{-} \\
  >    c & \color{green}{\text{T}} & \color{green}{\text{T}} & \text{-} \\
  >    \end{array}
  >    \]  
  >    \((c \land b)\) is false at \(t_1\) before \(a\) occurs → **VIOLATION**.  

#### Key Clarifications  
1. **Constraint duration**:  
   - \((c \land b)\) is **only required until \(a\) happens**.  
   - Once \(a\) occurs, \(c\)/\(b\) **can be true/false freely** afterward.  

2. **Edge case**:  
   - If \(a\) is **already true** at evaluation time \(i\):  
     - The formula is **immediately satisfied**, regardless of \(c\) and \(b\) at \(i\).  

3. **Misconception**:  
   - **Not** "\(a\) must occur, and \((c \land b)\) must hold until **including** \(a\)."  
     - At time \(j\) when \(a\) is true: **No check** of \((c \land b)\) is done.

### Final Phrasing  
"**Eventually, \(a\) must occur; until the exact moment before \(a\) becomes true, \(c\) and \(b\) must continuously be true together. If \(a\) is already true now, no further checks are needed.**"
