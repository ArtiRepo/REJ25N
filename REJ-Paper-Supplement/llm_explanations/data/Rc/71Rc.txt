### Translation and Explanation of LTL Formula: \( G(a \land \neg b) \)

**Original Formula:**  
\( G(a \land \neg b) \)

---

#### Parsing Tree Breakdown:
1. **Root Operator:** \( G \) (Global).  
   - Applies to subformula: \( a \land \neg b \).  

2. **Conjunction:** \( \land \) (Logical AND).  
   - Left operand: \( a \) (atomic proposition).  
   - Right operand: \( \neg b \) (negation of atomic proposition).  

3. **Negation:** \( \neg \).  
   - Applied to: \( b \) (atomic proposition).  

Tree Structure:  
```
     G  
     |  
     ∧  
    / \  
   a   ¬  
        \  
         b  
```

#### Step-by-Step Rebuilding of Meaning:
1. **Atomic Propositions:**  
   - \( a \): Holds if variable \( a \) is true in the current state.  
   - \( b \): Holds if variable \( b \) is true in the current state.  

2. **Negation (\(\neg b\)):**  
   - Holds if \( b \) is **false** in the current state.  
   - **Constraint:** Directly binds \( b \) to false at the state of evaluation.  

3. **Conjunction (\(a \land \neg b\)):**  
   - Holds if \( a \) is true **and** \( b \) is false **in the same state**.  
   - **Constraint:** Simultaneously requires \( a \) true and \( b \) false at the current state.  

4. **Global Operator (\(G\)):**  
   - Requires \( a \land \neg b \) to hold **in every state** of the sequence, from the first state onward.  
   - **Constraint:** Binds both \( a \) and \( b \) in **every future state** indefinitely.

#### Natural Language Translation:  
> "At every moment, \( a \) must be true and \( b \) must be false."

---

#### Key Explanations:
1. **When Constraints Apply:**  
   - **Every state** (starting immediately and continuing endlessly) is constrained.  
   - Variables \( a \) and \( b \) are bound in **all states**: \( a \) must be `true`, \( b \) must be `false`.  
   - **No failures allowed:** Even a single violation in any state makes the formula false.  

2. **Evaluation Over Time:**  
   - **Now (initial state):** Both \( a = \top \) and \( b = \bot \) must hold.  
   - **All future states:** Identical constraint applies perpetually.  
   - **Constraints never cease:** The obligation persists infinitely.  

3. **Satisfaction vs. Violation:**  
   - **Satisfied only if:**  
     All states fulfill \( a = \top \) and \( b = \bot \).  
     *Example:* \((a=\top, b=\bot), (a=\top, b=\bot), (a=\top, b=\bot), \ldots\)  
   - **Violated if:**  
     At **any state** (even one), \( a = \bot \) **or** \( b = \top \).  
     *Examples:*  
     - State 0: \(a=\bot, b=\bot\) → ✗ (\(a\) false).  
     - State 3: \(a=\top, b=\top\) → ✗ (\(b\) true).  

4. **Potential Misunderstandings:**  
   - ❌ "Eventually, \(a \land \neg b\) holds forever."  
     *(This describes \(F G(a \land \neg b)\), not \(G(a \land \neg b)\).)*  
   - ❌ "Constraints weaken over time."  
     *(Obligation is absolute at every state; no expiration.)*  
   - ❌ "Past/future states relax the constraint."  
     *(No temporal relaxation: *all* states are equally strict.)*  

---

#### Final Refined Phrasing:  
> **"Globally, for all time, \( a \) is true and \( b \) is false without exception."**  

This emphasizes:  
- Perpetual enforcement,  
- Strict synchronization (both conditions in the same state),  
- Zero tolerance for deviations.
